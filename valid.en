 You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways, who still feel their past in the wind, touch it in stones polished by rain, taste it in the bitter leaves of plants. 
 Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way, or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning, or that in the Himalaya, the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma, is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but is just one model of reality, the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago. 
 And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives. 
 We're all born. We all bring our children into the world. 
 We go through initiation rites. 
 We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death, so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance, we all have art. 
 But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song, the rhythm of the dance in every culture. 
 And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo, or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti, or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya, the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes, or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma, Everest, the goddess mother of the world. 
 All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being, other ways of thinking, other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth. 
 And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only fill you with hope. 
 Now, together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet, and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere. 
 And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an ethnosphere, and you might define the ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths, ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness. 
 The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy. 
 It's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species. 
 And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded, so too is the ethnosphere -- and, if anything, at a far greater rate. 
 No biologists, for example, would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true, and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity. 
 And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss. 
 When each of you in this room were born, there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet. 
 Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules. 
 A language is a flash of the human spirit. 
 It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world. 
 Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind, a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities. 
 And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey, fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children. 
 They're no longer being taught to babies, which means, effectively, unless something changes, they're already dead. 
 What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence, to be the last of your people to speak your language, to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children? 
 And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks, because every two weeks, some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue. 
 And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better, wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great, let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese. 
 Let's make it Kogi." 
 And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language. 
 And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere, a brief journey through the ethnosphere, to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost. 
 Now, there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say "different ways of being," I really do mean different ways of being. 
 Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon, the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes. 
 Now, this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend. 
 They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called "linguistic exogamy:" you must marry someone who speaks a different language. 
 And this is all rooted in the mythological past, yet the curious thing is in these long houses, where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage, you never hear anyone practicing a language. 
 They simply listen and then begin to speak. 
 Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with, the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador, an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958. 
 In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake. 
 They dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures, forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives. 
 They picked up these photographs from the forest floor, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure, found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death. 
 But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders. 
 They speared each other. 
 54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other. 
 We traced genealogies back eight generations, and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it, they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. 
 But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing. 
 Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind. 
 In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti, infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength and Tonton Macoutes, and securing the poison used to make zombies. 
 In order to make sense out of sensation, of course, I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult. 
 On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview. 
 It's interesting. 
 If I asked you to name the great religions of the world, what would you say? 
 Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever. 
 There's always one continent left out, the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era. 
 But, what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it's this living relationship between the living and the dead. 
 So, the living give birth to the spirits. 
 The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water, responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living, so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god. 
 That's why the Voodooists like to say that "You white people go to church and speak about God. 
 We dance in the temple and become God." 
 And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed? 
 So you see these astonishing demonstrations: Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity, a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation. 
 Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with, the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia. 
 Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia, in the wake of the conquest, these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain. 
 In a bloodstained continent, these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish. 
 To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary. 
 The young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years: two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother's womb; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother. 
 And for this entire time, they are inculturated into the values of their society, values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance. 
 And at the end of this amazing initiation, one day they're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18, they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape, suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you. 
 It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect." 
 They call themselves the "elder brothers" and they say we, who are the younger brothers, are the ones responsible for destroying the world. 
 Now, this level of intuition becomes very important. 
 Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape, we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the "noble savage," which is an idea racist in its simplicity, or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are. 
 Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia. 
 There's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless, through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it, but on a far subtler intuition: the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness. 
 Now, what does that mean? 
 It means that a young kid from the Andes who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined. 
 Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant. 
 What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world. 
 I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut. 
 That made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world, spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation. 
 Now, if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities, you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here. 
 It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April. 
 This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about, the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman's repertoire. 
 What makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation, but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources: on the one hand, this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines, harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis. 
 This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines, very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine, 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine. 
 If you've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses, that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine. 
 To have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. 
 It doesn't create the distortion of reality; it creates the dissolution of reality. 
 In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. 
 But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase. 
 They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO. 
 Now, the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question. 
 How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants, do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way, created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts? 
 Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error," which is exposed to be meaningless. 
 But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us." 
 Well, what does that mean? 
 This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca, all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest, all of which are referable to our eye as one species. 
 And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants. 
 I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No." 
 Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key. 
 Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. 
 Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world, meaning our world, moves on. 
 Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now, is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations, but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change. 
 All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life. 
 And the problem is not technology itself. 
 The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy. 
 It's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power, the crude face of domination. 
 Wherever you look around the world, you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to: whether it's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago, and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers, where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea, where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or, in the case of the Yanomami, it's the disease entities that have come in, in the wake of the discovery of gold. 
 Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet, where I'm doing a lot of research recently, you'll see it's a crude face of political domination. 
 You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned, but ethnocide, the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned, it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated as part of a development strategy. 
 And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level. 
 I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about: 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes, 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution. 
 This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama. 
 That meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion. 
 His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal. 
 His mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy. 
 He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn't bear to be without him. 
 The sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp. 
 One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao, and for that transgression, she was given seven years of hard labor. 
 The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear, but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold. 
 And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice: do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity? 
 Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died, that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought, but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities. 
 And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps, been around for [150,000] years. 
 The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture, at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago. 
 The modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old. 
 Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia. 
 When these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human, they respond with 10,000 different voices. 
 And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are: a fully conscious species, fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism. 
 This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people, and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather. 
 The Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s, to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements. 
 This old man's grandfather refused to go. 
 The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons, all of his tools. 
 Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold; they took advantage of it. 
 The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide. 
 So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing. 
 He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze, he shaped it into the form of a blade. 
 He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it. 
 He skinned the dog and improvised a harness, took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled, harnessed up an adjacent dog, and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt. 
 Talk about getting by with nothing. 
 And this, in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world. 
 The Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together. 
 It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut. 
 It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources. 
 An amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people. 
 And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet, to realize that they're not remote at all. 
 They're homelands of somebody. 
 They represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us, the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children, become part of the naked geography of hope. 
 So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally, is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything. 
 We think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive, but we think that storytelling can change the world, and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month. 
 156 nations carry our television channel. 
 Our magazines are read by millions. 
 And what we're doing is a series of journeys to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore, embrace gradually, one by one, the central revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being. 
 Thank you very much. 
 What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. 
 We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through the thing, rearranging it in any way we want. 
 And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. 
 Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range. 
 It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. It's also very flexible architecture. 
 This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data. 
 This is "Bleak House" by Dickens. Every column is a chapter. 
 To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture. 
 Maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book. 
 I wouldn't recommend it. 
 This is a more realistic case. This is an issue of The Guardian. 
 Every large image is the beginning of a section. 
 And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium. 
 We've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. 
 We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than you'd be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content. 
 If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. 
 Or other models, or even technical specifications. 
 And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. 
 We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary. 
 Of course, mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this. 
 And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. 
 But those are all the roads in the U.S. 
 superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. 
 So let's pull up, now, something else. 
 This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out. 
 This is a project called Photosynth, which really marries two different technologies. 
 One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. 
 and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. A very nice collaboration. 
 And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. 
 You can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience. 
 But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. 
 The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken. So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially. 
 I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. 
 There are some that are much more spatial. 
 I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind this technology, the Photosynth technology. And it's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we've put up on the website. 
 We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. 
 This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts, and of the campus and so on. And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. 
 And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. 
 And we can just navigate in this very simple way. 
 You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. 
 It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. 
 I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. 
 And if I can, I'll find some of the sort of weird ones. 
 So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on. 
 Somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go. 
 This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. 
 We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. 
 What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. 
 All of those photos become linked together, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. 
 You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. 
 Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. 
 And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. 
 Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. 
 If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way. 
 And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory. 
 Thank you so much. 
 Do I understand this right? That what your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together? 
 Yes. What this is really doing is discovering. 
 It's creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images. 
 And it's doing that based on the content inside the images. 
 And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have. 
 Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. 
 Now, what if that picture links to all of your pictures? 
 Then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge. It's a classic network effect. 
 Blaise, that is truly incredible. Congratulations. 
 Thanks so much. 
 I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard, and I'll try to make some connections myself, in case you miss them. 
 I want to start with what I call the "official dogma." 
 The official dogma of what? 
 The official dogma of all western industrial societies. 
 And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom. 
 The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human. 
 And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare, and no one has to decide on our behalf. 
 The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice. 
 The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have. 
 This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it. 
 And it's also deeply embedded in our lives. 
 I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us. 
 This is my supermarket. Not such a big one. 
 I want to say just a word about salad dressing. 
 175 salad dressings in my supermarket, if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings, in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you. 
 So this is what the supermarket is like. 
 And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stereo systems. 
 We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store. 
 You've got to admit that's a lot of choice. 
 In other domains -- the world of communications. 
 There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from Ma Bell. 
 You rented your phone. You didn't buy it. 
 One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke. 
 And those days are gone. 
 We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones. 
 These are cell phones of the future. 
 My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and creme brulee torch. 
 And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assured that one day soon you will. 
 And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question. 
 And do you know what the answer to this question now is? 
 The answer is "No." 
 It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much. 
 So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true. 
 Health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do. 
 Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B. 
 A has these benefits, and these risks. 
 B has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?" 
 And you say, "Doc, what should I do?" 
 And the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks. 
 What do you want to do?" 
 And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?" 
 And the doc says, "But I'm not you." 
 And the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy," which makes it sound like a good thing, but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely, the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely, the patient. 
 There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them. 
 Why do they market to us if we can't buy them? 
 The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed. 
 Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate. 
 We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it. 
 And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like. 
 And that means that everyday, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be. 
 With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could. 
 The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after. 
 Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs. 
 I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to. 
 And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less diligent. 
 It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves, "Should I get married or not? Should I get married now? 
 Should I get married later? Should I have kids first, or a career first?" 
 All of these are consuming questions. 
 And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses. 
 And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer. 
 Work -- we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel. 
 There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi works. 
 I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it. 
 So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working. 
 We can go to watch our kid play soccer, and we have our cell phone on one hip, and our Blackberry on our other hip, and our laptop, presumably, on our laps. 
 And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, "Should I answer this cell phone call? 
 Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?" 
 And even if the answer to the question is "no," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been. 
 So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice. 
 And the world we used to live in looked like this. 
 That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice. 
 And the world we now live in looks like this. 
 And the question is, is this good news, or bad news? 
 And the answer is yes. 
 We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it. 
 All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people. 
 One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation. 
 With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. 
 I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans. 
 A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard, the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces. 
 And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent. 
 You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why? 
 Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow. 
 And then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes. 
 Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer. 
 By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution. 
 So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices. 
 And I think it makes the world look like this. 
 You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right? 
 You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or even the wrong salad dressing. 
 So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from. 
 And there are several reasons for this. 
 One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and, you know, what salad dressing is? -- it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision. 
 The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose. 
 Second, what economists call "opportunity costs." 
 Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to. 
 Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject, that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen. 
 Here's an example. For those of you who aren't New Yorkers, I apologize. 
 But here's what you're supposed to be thinking. 
 Here's this couple on the Hamptons. 
 Very expensive real estate. 
 Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves. 
 What could be better? "Well, damn it," this guy is thinking, "It's August. 
 Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away. 
 I could be parking right in front of my building." 
 And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space. 
 Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific. 
 And the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs. 
 Here's another example. 
 Now this cartoon makes a lot of points. 
 It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly. 
 But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things. 
 And those other things may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive. 
 Third: escalation of expectations. 
 This hit me when I went to replace my jeans. 
 I wear jeans almost all the time. 
 And there was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap, and they were incredibly uncomfortable, and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK. 
 So I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones, and I said, you know, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size." 
 And the shopkeeper said, "Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit? 
 You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed? 
 Do you want them distressed? 
 You want boot cut, you want tapered, blah blah blah ..." On and on he went. 
 My jaw dropped, and after I recovered, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kind." 
 He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans, and I walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had. 
 I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better. 
 But I felt worse. 
 Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself. 
 The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up. 
 I had very low -- I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor. 
 When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect. 
 And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect. 
 And so I compared what I got to what I expected, and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected. 
 Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be. 
 And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results. 
 Nobody in the world of marketing knows this, because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about. 
 The truth is more like this. 
 The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise. 
 Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be. 
 You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof. 
 The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations. 
 I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful. 
 I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle. 
 But settling isn't always such a bad thing. 
 Finally, one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible. What could you do? 
 When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who's responsible? 
 It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you. 
 You could have done better. 
 With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure. 
 And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves. 
 Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation. 
 I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault. 
 And so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse. 
 So let me remind you. 
 This is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all false. It is not true. 
 There's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice. 
 There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is. 
 I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare. 
 Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done -- as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence. 
 There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice. 
 Their problem is that they have too little. 
 So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies. 
 And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money. 
 What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help. 
 They actually hurt. 
 They actually make us worse off. 
 If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also. 
 This is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move." 
 Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us. 
 So to conclude. You're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "Ah! What does this fish know? 
 You know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl." 
 Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at first. 
 The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something. 
 Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. You have paralysis. 
 If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction. 
 You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction. 
 Everybody needs a fishbowl. 
 This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us. 
 But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and, I suspect, disaster. 
 Thank you very much. 
 You know, I've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean, and discovering new sets of genes. 
 We're actually starting at a new point: we've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. 
 So, we've always been trying to ask big questions. 
 "What is life?" is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels. 
 We've tried various approaches, paring it down to minimal components. 
 We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years; when we sequenced the human genome, it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer. 
 Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe?" 
 This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium, that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory, and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome. 
 We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here. 
 When we look at its metabolic map, it's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me, this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time, it's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell. 
 So we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions. 
 And so we started down the road of: can we synthesize a chromosome? 
 Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? 
 And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome? 
 A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. 
 So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. 
 Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing, and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve. 
 We started this over 15 years ago. 
 It took several stages, in fact, starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments. 
 But it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult. 
 There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece, the more errors there are. 
 So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors. 
 And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174. 
 It's a small virus that kills bacteria. 
 We designed the pieces, went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters. 
 The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, made the viral particles. 
 The viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli. 
 I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model. 
 They laughed more than you guys are. 
 And so, we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system. 
 But we wanted to go much larger: we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are. 
 Design is critical, and if you're starting with digital information in the computer, that digital information has to be really accurate. 
 When we first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs. 
 We actually found, on resequencing it, 30 errors; had we used that original sequence, it never would have been able to be booted up. 
 Part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together. 
 We design unique elements into this. 
 You may have read that we put watermarks in. 
 Think of this: we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T. 
 Triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids, such that there's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids. 
 So we can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts. 
 Initially, all we did was autograph it. 
 Some people were disappointed there was not poetry. 
 We designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together. 
 And we started making pieces, starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters, put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces, then put sets of those going up to 72,000. 
 At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust that you can see in a minute. 
 We're trying to get to the point of automation. 
 So, this looks like a basketball playoff. 
 When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs, they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms. 
 We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together. 
 Here's an example of it: there's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation. 
 You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart. 
 Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was before. 
 We have thousands of organisms that can do this. 
 These organisms can be totally desiccated; they can live in a vacuum. 
 I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new aqueous environment. 
 In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there. 
 Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in; yeast puts them together automatically. 
 This is not an electron micrograph; this is just a regular photomicrograph. 
 It's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope. 
 These are pictures over about a six-second period. 
 So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago. 
 This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code; it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. 
 It's over 300 million molecular weight. 
 If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing, it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code. 
 Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this? 
 Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple; it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria. 
 It's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves: you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cloning. 
 With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell, but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it. 
 We purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome, we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins, and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here. 
 The new chromosome went into the cell. 
 In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went, but we tried to design the process a little bit further. 
 This is a major mechanism of evolution right here. 
 We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere, adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species. 
 So, people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology. 
 There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA. 
 The chromosome that was in the cell doesn't have one; the chromosome we put in does. 
 It got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material, chewed it up, and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome. 
 It turned blue because of the genes we put in it. 
 And with a very short period of time, all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell. 
 All the proteins changed, the membranes changed; when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in. 
 So, this may sound like genomic alchemy, but we can, by moving the software of DNA around, change things quite dramatically. 
 Now I've argued, this is not genesis; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. 
 And I've argued that we're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion, where there's massive new speciation based on this digital design. 
 Why do this? 
 I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs. 
 We're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years. 
 To put it in context for myself: I was born in 1946. 
 There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946; within 40 years, there'll be four. 
 We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water, medicines, fuel for the six and a half billion. 
 It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine. 
 We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that's a hundred million barrels a day. 
 When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge. 
 Then of course, there's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere. 
 We now, from our discovery around the world, have a database with about 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the future. 
 The electronics industry only had a dozen or so components, and look at the diversity that came out of that. 
 We're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination. 
 We now have techniques, because of these rapid methods of synthesis, to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics. 
 We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. 
 When you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals, new vaccines, we can just with a small team, do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science. 
 And it's just standard selection: we can select for viability, chemical or fuel production, vaccine production, etc. 
 This is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer. 
 You know, we don't know necessarily what it'll look like: we know exactly what their genetic code looks like. 
 We're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels. 
 You've seen recently, corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment. 
 We have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol. 
 But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock, and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road. 
 And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months. 
 Sunlight and CO2 is one method ... 
 but in our discovery around the world, we have all kinds of other methods. 
 This is an organism we described in 1996. 
 It lives in the deep ocean, about a mile and a half deep, almost at boiling-water temperatures. 
 It takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source. 
 We're looking to see if we can take captured CO2, which can easily be piped to sites, convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process. 
 So, in a short period of time, we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of "What is life?" 
 We truly, you know, have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry -- Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? -- become a major source of energy ... 
 But also, we're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines. 
 You've seen this year with flu; we're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine. 
 I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance. 
 Here's what the future may begin to look like with changing, now, the evolutionary tree, speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria, Archaea and, eventually, eukaryotes. 
 We're a ways away from improving people: our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much. 
 Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC. 
 And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked. 
 So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference. 
 Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second. 
 It's nothing if not ambitious. 
 This is the machine below Geneva. 
 We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors. 
 This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter. 
 Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale. 
 On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time. 
 And this picture was taken by ATLAS. 
 It caused immense celebration in the control room. 
 It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector. 
 In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph. 
 I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that. 
 It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact. 
 About a week later we had a problem with the machine, related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires. 
 Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power. 
 Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, "No they don't. They're small wires." 
 They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire. 
 So at minus 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, those wires can take that current. 
 In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect. 
 So the wire heated up slightly, and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance. 
 This was the result. 
 Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons, and they moved about a foot. 
 So we damaged about 50 of the magnets. 
 We had to take them out, which we did. 
 We reconditioned them all, fixed them. 
 They're all on their way back underground now. 
 By the end of March the LHC will be intact again. 
 We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or July, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are. 
 Now of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute. 
 I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC. 
 I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy, who, I suspect, when defending his protege's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this, "Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer." 
 Thank you. 
 I am a writer. 
 Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course. 
 It is also my great lifelong love and fascination. 
 And I don't expect that that's ever going to change. 
 But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work. 
 And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing. 
 The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed. 
 Seriously -- doomed, doomed! 
 Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say, "Aren't you afraid -- aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that? 
 Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?" 
 So that's reassuring, you know. 
 But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager -- that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same kind of, sort of fear-based reaction. 
 And people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success? 
 Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you? 
 Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?" 
 Like that, you know. 
 The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes." 
 Yes, I'm afraid of all those things. 
 And I always have been. 
 And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at. 
 Like seaweed, and other things that are scary. 
 But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why? 
 You know, is it rational? 
 Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do. 
 You know, and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know? 
 Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know? 
 It didn't -- that chemical engineering block John, how's it going? 
 It just didn't come up like that, you know? 
 But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives. 
 We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable. 
 And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know? 
 And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know. 
 Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said "Every one of my books has killed me a little more." 
 An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work, you know. 
 But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish. 
 And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea? 
 Are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know -- I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption. 
 I think it's odious. 
 And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century. 
 I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live. 
 And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption, particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career. 
 Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old. 
 I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me. 
 And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right? 
 I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me. 
 Oh, so Jesus, what a thought! 
 You know that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there. 
 I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love. 
 And so, the question becomes, how? 
 And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right? 
 I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on. 
 And, as I've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people, sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity. 
 And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. 
 So stay with me, because it does circle around and back. 
 But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, O.K.? 
 People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons. 
 The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons." 
 Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. 
 The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. 
 Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. 
 They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work. 
 So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work. 
 And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right? 
 So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right? 
 If your work was brilliant you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you. 
 If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know? 
 Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame. 
 And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time. 
 And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine. 
 And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual. 
 And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius. 
 And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error. 
 You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche. 
 It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun. 
 It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance. 
 And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years. 
 And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now? 
 Can we do this differently? 
 Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery. 
 Maybe not. 
 Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech. 
 And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff. 
 I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this. 
 But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not? 
 Why not think about it this way? 
 Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process. 
 A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally. 
 And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal. 
 I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape. 
 And she said it was like a thunderous train of air. 
 And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape. 
 And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet. 
 She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "run like hell." 
 And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page. 
 And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "for another poet." 
 And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right? 
 So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it. 
 She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page. 
 And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first. 
 So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like. 
 That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline! 
 I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly. 
 But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times. 
 And I would imagine that a lot of you have too. 
 You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify. 
 And what is that thing? 
 And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane? 
 And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment. 
 And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized. 
 But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me, and this is when it all changed for him. 
 And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, you know, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it. 
 He doesn't have a piece of paper, he doesn't have a pencil, he doesn't have a tape recorder. 
 So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and then I'm going to be haunted by this song forever. 
 I'm not good enough, and I can't do it." 
 And instead of panicking, he just stopped. 
 He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel. 
 He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?" 
 "Do I look like I can write down a song right now? 
 If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you. 
 Otherwise, go bother somebody else today. 
 Go bother Leonard Cohen." 
 And his whole work process changed after that. 
 Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever. 
 But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it kind of back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing. 
 It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom. 
 So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and it already saved me once. 
 This idea, it saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those, sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, this is going to be the worst book ever written. 
 Not just bad, but the worst book ever written. 
 And I started to think I should just dump this project. 
 But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it. 
 So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room. 
 And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right? 
 Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this. 
 So if you want it to be better, then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal. 
 O.K. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it. 
 I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job. 
 And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job." 
 Because -- in the end it's like this, O.K. -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn. 
 And they were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right? 
 But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent. 
 And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this. 
 It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align. 
 And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human. 
 He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity. 
 And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name. 
 They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God." 
 That's God, you know. 
 Curious historical footnote -- when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Ole, ole, ole," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances. 
 In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic, "Allah, ole, ole, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God. 
 Which is great, because we need that. 
 But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God. 
 He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again. 
 And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life? 
 This is hard. 
 This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life. 
 But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you. 
 But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else. 
 And, you know, if we think about it this way it starts to change everything. 
 This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success. 
 And what I have to, sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that, is, don't be afraid. 
 Don't be daunted. 
 Just do your job. 
 Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be. 
 If your job is to dance, do your dance. 
 If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment through your efforts, then "Ole!" 
 And if not, do your dance anyhow. 
 And "Ole!" to you, nonetheless. 
 I believe this and I feel that we must teach it. 
 "Ole!" to you, nonetheless, just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Ole! 
 Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent. 
 But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. 
 The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system. 
 It expands in winter and contracts in summer. 
 The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years. 
 The permanent ice is marked in red. 
 As you see, it expands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer. 
 The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, spilling out of the body here. 
 In 25 years it's gone from this, to this. 
 This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes. 
 Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. 
 Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. 
 Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. 
 Whoa! 
 She's okay. The question is whether we will be. 
 And one reason is, this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. 
 This is an annual melting river. 
 But the volumes are much larger than ever. 
 This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. 
 If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. 
 These flows are increasing very rapidly. 
 At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. 
 Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. 
 And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands, is particularly rapid in its melting. 
 That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland. 
 In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers. 
 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. 
 In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. 
 The flows have increased. 
 But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water. 
 In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. 
 This is hitting the reservoirs. 
 And the predictions, as you've read, are serious. 
 This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. 
 And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. 
 Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75. 
 This is a completely unsustainable pattern. 
 If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. 
 In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans. 
 Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americas, extending westward, and on either side of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. 
 The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. 
 Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem. 
 The United States is one of the two largest emitters, along with China. 
 And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. 
 But we're beginning to see a sea change. 
 Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. 
 However there is a political battle in our country. 
 And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron. 
 That image reminded me of something. 
 Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. 
 You probably saw it on the news. 
 This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America. 
 This happened around Christmas. 
 One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. 
 Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul. 
 He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow. 
 Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. 
 He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay. 
 This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. 
 The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. 
 Let me be clear about it. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about. 
 So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. 
 This is one of them, part of one of them. 
 At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. 
 That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. 
 The fact is, coal isn't dirty. 
 We think it's clean -- smells good, too. 
 So don't worry about climate change. 
 Leave that up to us. 
 Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it. 
 So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility. 
 Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud. 
 But that's the sound of clean coal technology. 
 And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. 
 Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology. 
 Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. 
 America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis. 
 The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil. 
 But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. 
 Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years. 
 A plan to put America back to work, make us more secure, and help stop global warming. 
 Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. 
 Repower America. Find out more. 
 This is the last one. 
 It's about repowering America. 
 One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. 
 Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid. 
 New investments to create high-paying jobs. 
 Repower America. It's time to get real. 
 There is an old African proverb that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone. 
 If you want to go far, go together." 
 We need to go far, quickly. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid, playing with blocks. 
 As you figured out how to reach out and grasp, pick them up and move them around, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships. 
 Spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us. 
 So, as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer, instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop, what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically, arranging it the way we wanted? 
 This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer, by building Siftables. 
 In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie. 
 They're able to be moved around by hand, they can sense each other, they can sense their motion, and they have a screen and a wireless radio. 
 Most importantly, they're physical, so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping. 
 And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information. 
 And as these tools become more physical, more aware of their motion, aware of each other, and aware of the nuance of how we move them, we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles. 
 So, I'm going to start with some simple examples. 
 This Siftable is configured to show video, and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards. 
 And these interactive portraits are aware of each other. 
 So if I put them next to each other, they get interested. 
 If they get surrounded, they notice that too, they might get a little flustered. 
 And they can also sense their motion and tilt. 
 One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize, was that we could use everyday gestures on data, like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid. 
 So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one, where they get mixed. 
 If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back. 
 There are also some neat possibilities for education, like language, math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly, and view the results immediately. 
 So here I'm -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. 
 Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle. 
 Basically, in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable, and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary. 
 Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles, and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. 
 Thank you. 
 So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab, and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video. 
 They really loved it. 
 And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don't have to give people many instructions. 
 All you have to say is, "Make words," and they know exactly what to do. 
 So here's another few people trying it out. 
 That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right. 
 Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up. 
 So to him, they were just blocks. 
 Now, this is an interactive cartoon application. 
 And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners. 
 And this is Felix, actually. 
 And he can bring new characters into the scene, just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them. 
 Here, he's bringing the sun out. 
 The sun is rising. 
 Now he's brought a tractor into the scene. 
 The orange tractor. 
 Good job! Yeah! 
 So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Woof! 
 inventing his own narrative. 
 Hello! 
 It's an open-ended story, and he gets to decide how it unfolds. 
 Fly away, cat. 
 So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we've built recently, in which Siftables act as sounds like lead, bass and drums. 
 Each of these has four different variations, you get to choose which one you want to use. 
 And you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want. 
 And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable. 
 There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter. 
 You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it. 
 And then, overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence. 
 So let's have a look. 
 We'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series, extend it, add a little more lead. 
 Now I put a bass line in. 
 Now I'll put some percussion in. 
 And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live. 
 I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other. 
 And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. 
 I can rearrange the sequence while it plays. 
 So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise, making it longer or shorter as I go. 
 And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left. 
 Thank you. 
 So, as you can see, my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work. 
 And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space, and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory. 
 So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms. 
 Thank you very much. 
 I look forward to talking with all of you. 
 Yes , hello . 
 I'm happy to be here . 
 Yes , so , what is biohacking ? 
 I'll have to provide some background information here , biohacking deals with modern molecular biology . 
 I study molecular biology and have been doing research into biohacking for a few years now , I started doing this because I simply wanted to have more detailed knowledge and especially wanted to put what I'd learned theoretically into practice . 
 So these were my prime motives . 
 So it was curiosity and I somehow wanted to get closer to the material , that was it . 
 I think that molecular biology in general , so generally speaking biotechnology , everything that can be included in that , like synthetic biology, etc. 
 is of extreme importance today is already extremely important today and will become much more important in the future . 
 There are controversial topics such as all those genetically modified plants in the fields . 
 Now there's Craig Venter in the USA who's trying to produce biofuel , biodiesel fuel made from algae . 
 And then there are things that have already become part of everyday life , although most people are not aware of it , such as washing powder enzymes , which allow us to wash clothes at forty degrees , which are also genetically optimised enzymes . 
 And the list can go on forever . 
 And So because of my interest in the in this technology , I went delved into it more . 
 So what Why hacking ? 
 Most of us know Most people have heard of this in the context of software . 
 Computer hacking , and then in the media it's Yes , hackers break into a place and steal data and so on . 
 That's rather sad for the hacker community , because it doesn't at all fully describe what they actually how it actually all started and what's behind it . 
 Software hackers started building computers in the seventies and eighties and this gave rise to the Internet . 
 And it deals with problem-solving in a playful , creative , original way . 
 And a problem , so not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also just be an access problem that simplifying things , so any way of looking at a problem , of posing a question , asking how you could do something differently or better . 
 And it was it developed in the area of software , but it's also found in the electronics sector where you also find a whole tinkerer scene , which makes all sorts of crazy things with electrical circuits . 
 And so now you find it in biology , and I'd like to take a metaphor from synthetic biology, Biology is actually an information science because the DNA code is an abstract code that yes , it's not exactly like a computer , because it's more dynamic , because it's material , I mean real material , and not just cybernetic . 
 But it's also a code , and you can program that and so you can also hack into it , that's it , and I thought think it's incredibly fascinating , and I just wanted to really delve into that . 
 These these networks didn't really take form until two thousand eight . 
 There's hackteria dot org , which originally comes from Switzerland , and it's a network based in Europe with a cooperation in India , but it has members and active people all over the world by now . 
 Those are it has a more arty character , so it's many artists and philosophers are working , together with scientists , on examining these technologies and asking questions and processing the knowledge creatively , there are museum exhibitions and , well, all sorts of things . 
 But the point is to always find a a really loose approach to it , to deal with it playfully . 
 And then there's do-it-yourself-bio- dot-org , DIY bio . 
 That's a network from the USA , that's more of a kind of a forum , where you where people can meet and discuss things online . 
 They are geared more towards the technical as well as the business aspects of it , and so you see more, well, practical questions being asked . 
 Based on these networks , which made the whole thing popular , a scene came into being , which I'd like to briefly describe . 
 This picture on the left is of Biocurious , that's a hackerspace , so a kind of school , a private school , a non-profit organisation institution , where anybody can go to . 
 Children , elderly people , all sorts of people go there to simply examine this in a different kind of way , they've set up a laboratory and look at what can be done there , if at laboratory protocols . 
 Here in the bottom left there's a group in Indonesia , House of Natural Fibers it's called , but they've been around for quite some time . 
 For a longer time than these other two networks . 
 They look at biological materials in an artistic way and , yes, also electronic tinkering , and combine this in a very outlandish way . 
 A group from Ankara , that I came into contact with a while ago , they have they are a student group that wanted to inform the public more about what what they learn about at university , and they organised these these little actions at street festivals and tried to explain DNA to people . 
 And in this other image at the top I have a lecture in in Copenhagen at the Medical Museion in combination with an exhibition on the topic . 
 And That's , well That's These are usually really young people , but the only thing that that one that really unites everybody , is this fascination with technology . 
 And what you can do with it and approaching society very targetedly and asking, right, okay, what do you know, what what do you want to get involved in , are you interested in getting involved in this way ? 
 So , okay , to hack into biology , you need material . 
 You need biological materials , but you also need tools, and that's a laboratory . 
 Or what you would normally understand to be a laboratory , so some cool machines , extremely expensive ones, extremely distant ones, for professional staff, trained academics with a doctor's degree etc. only . 
 And our approach was to say , okay, that you don't actually have to do that . 
 That's not necessary in fact , because every every every coffee machine actually uses more advanced technology than most laboratory devices , that's really true . 
 And So with this premises with this premises , Brian Degger in England , for example , tried to set up a mini-laboratory , took a pressure cooker , a hot plate and , yes , soup stock , and bred bacteria with it , working like this . 
 So anybody who's ever had a soup gone go bad , because they left it standing for too long , has already done this . 
 I then tried to expand this at my laboratory back home , and so I bought some secondhand equipment on eBay and did a little DNA analysis , and tried to do a paternity test, so DNA fingerprinting in other words , at home again . 
 That's not supposed to be a joke , but Here in the image below you can see there's the laboratory , in quotation marks , so a closed up garage with all this laboratory equipment that the university got rid of , a group in Paris that set something set up something and is very successful with it and does some really interesting things there. I'd like to briefly mention a project . 
 That here is Biocurious , the hackerspace I mentioned just now , this yes , basically a kind of adult education centre for for molecular biology . 
 And yes , so you can see that it's a relatively relatively heterogeneous thing , so from some people who do it on their own from home , to big I mean , larger organisations , who are doing this more formally in an institutionalised form already . 
 But always always with this this approach , that it should be simple and accessible . 
 The first project that we did as an international group , when we became aware of ourselves , you might say , okay we exist as a real “scene” , and we're online , and we we know the people who are always chatting there and everything . 
 And then the founder of do-it-yourself-bio dot org came and said: okay 
 we really need to meet up now , meet up personally , and he organised two events , one in London , in two thousand ten , and shortly after that in the USA , in San Francisco . 
 And , the focus there was on , so okay , who are we , what do we want , what do we also want what do we want to talk about ? 
 And what what are our values and what are what are our objectives , our fundamental principles ? 
 And then we worked on writing up a kind of code of conduct . 
 That was really intuitive , I mean , everyone expressed their wishes , their and things that move them . 
 Then , in my opinion , a really good code was created . 
 And that was then It's not binding , but it's yes , I think it has managed to become accepted quite well , people are quite convinced about it , yes . 
 And then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but somehow it wasn't really well received there . 
 So I think we from the biohacker scene have , in that sense , gone a step further than the the academic world . 
 Yes , what sort of projects do we actually work on ? 
 A project I set up myself with the Hackteria network in Switzerland , was one in which we wanted to create a so-called optical trap or optical tweezers . 
 This is when you focus a laser beam on a in a space , and then you can catch little particles in the air with it or in in liquid and then move them in this focus , so , they're then trapped in there , so it's basically like a tractor beam . 
 That really works , it's done in an academic setting , and then we thought , okay , we might manage that , and took a webcam , dismantled it , took off the lens , turned it around and then we have a microscope , which has a four hundred fold magnification approximately . 
 You can see this at the bottom . 
 And then we took apart a DVD burner and took out the burner the laser and then tried to focus on this camera . 
 And unfortunately that didn't work , but we learned a lot in doing so anyhow . 
 Another project , that came from from the French group in Paris , did work , and that's pretty cool . 
 He took one of these well, one of these one of these devices that measure brain waves , an EEG or something like that , so he was working with neurobiology , his his nickname is Sam Neurohack . 
 He then made this this this helmet , and it took place in in cooperation with the museum . 
 Visitors could go into the room , sit down on this chair , and put on this helmet . 
 Their brain waves were then measured , and depending on what they thought about or how they thought , different lights in the roomwent switched on . 
 Was a very a very fancy project . 
 Another thing from the USA that also had to do with paternity test thing , is the the PCR , the Polymerase Chain Reaction, a complicated term . 
 This is about the copying of genes , replicating genes , DNA , fragments , so that you can make them visible . 
 so when I now That's what the what profilers do at a crime scene , they go there , collect some hair samples , and then they make these implement this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , like that . 
 And the machines that do that are rather expensive , the ones you buy commercially , they start at about four thousand euros at the least . 
 And that's not within the range of amateurs , but it's a really cool technology , which is capable of a lot . 
 So that's just one application among many that you can use . 
 And they have there were two two tinkerers who went to work on it and said, okay , we can make this easier and cheaper , and put together this this piece of equipment from open source stuff , so freely available hardware and electronics and they're now the they've now managed to make it ripe for the market and are currently the the cheapest providers of these devices worldwide . 
 I think the price lies at about six hundred dollars or so . 
 It's certainly now it's That's still not cheap , but it's certainly within a range that makes it much more accessible . 
 So that was a very successful hack in my opinion . 
 A project I recently started was the building of a gene gun . 
 A gene gun is , well , a kind of air pressure gun , which shoots about this far , two centimetres or so . 
 You charge gold particles with DNA and then put these gold particles into this air pressure gun , and then I shot at onions and made them light up and stuff like that . 
 So the device you see here didn't work . 
 But that's my my prototype , which looked pretty wild though, on a branch and that , that thing on it , put the electronics into it and connected pressure to it and that was but the pressure was too high , and the thing broke . 
 Then I took a whipped cream dispenser and connected it to that . 
 A whipped cream dispenser , when you fill it up with water , it has enough pressure , I think about forty to sixty bar . 
 And with that you can accelerate the particles strongly enough and then they enter the onions . 
 And the commercial device for this starts at about fifteen thousand euros or so , whereas whipped cream dispensers cost about fifty euros . 
 So the It's not as efficient , but it's basically doable . 
 So that's currently the the core objective of the scene , making the technology more available and increasing the information and comprehensibility , so that that more people can get involved . 
 Because as I said in the beginning , it's an extremely important technology and most people know relatively little about it and also have no chance of educating themselves really well on it . 
 Because if you just read about it in secondary literature , that's not the same as when you've done it yourself or have seen it being done . 
 And I think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies . 
 And if , as an informed citizen , you wish to make useful choices in society and want to take part in the discussion , you need access to the knowledge and the technology . 
 And And you need to do it and understand it if you want to do it and understand it . 
 And this trades under the names Open Knowledge and Citizen Science . 
 So as a citizen you are put in a position where you can look into these scientific technologies . 
 And that's that's the core concern of of biohackers . 
 Those are the people who are at least officially registered on the website , the DIY-bio-dot-org-website . 
 There's already a rather impressive number of people worldwide . 
 And it's also interesting that they're also represented in South-East-Asia . 
 That is I think they are Less people have registered than actually exist . 
 I know of some people who haven't registered . 
 And they are just the biohackers , individuals . 
 Some of them are also registered together with the hackerspaces , those places . 
 And that's just the beginning . 
 Like I said , it all just started in two thousand eight . 
 And hackerspaces , so computer hackerspaces , C-base in Berlin was the first , in nineteen ninety-five . 
 And that's become a gigantic network of very good , well , infrastructure centres , which are being represented all over the world . 
 And of course we hope that we'll expand in a similar way and also be similarly networked , so that more people can get involved. 
 And I would like to invite everyone to work on it and event try something yourselves . 
 It's not that simple , but it's also not impossible , and if you're curious enough and put enough energy into it , you can go far . 
 Thanks for listening . 
 That was all . 
 Yes , hello . 
 How do we humans actually function ? 
 This is a question that really moves me as a designer , but is also of relevance in the area of in the research area usability and especially in the area user experience . 
 There, the focus is on how to approach people in interactive media , so that they can use interactive media and can come to the most satisfying result possible . 
 I think that interactive media address archaic , cognitive models in us , in other words thought patterns that were programmed into our biological memory a very , very long time ago and can be elicited through interactive media . 
 And this is really incredible , because people actually believe that this advanced technology which you come into contact with there , that it transports you into the future , but in fact the future is in us , in our archaic roots . 
 So what are archaic models ? 
 I wrote down four keywords and would like to explain them briefly . 
 Archaic models are models that we adopted in pre-industrial times . 
 Intrinsic to these archaic models is the fact that we have a principally natural relationship with virtuality . 
 That might sound unusual at first . 
 I will clarify this in a moment , however , and will attempt to prove by an experiment , that you , too, do have a natural relation to virtuality . 
 And the second aspect is that since we because of these archaic models , we are certainly able to talk in a very , very visual manner , although we use a codified language today . 
 And the third area speaks for itself really . 
 We all know that interactive media is , by definition , non-linear , which involves the negation of linearity , and which of course tells us that we consider linearity normal today . 
 The fourth point is that we see history as a place where information is passed on . 
 But how is it with with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ? 
 I would like to prove that to you . 
 How many doors does the house you live in have ? 
 We You wouldn't be able to answer that spontaneously , but the following would happen and is happening at this very moment . 
 In your mind , you are walking through the house where you live , and are seeing how many doors there are . 
 That is exactly what you are doing . 
 You are virtualising the reality without a computer . 
 Fantastic , isn't it ? 
 At the media campus , for example , we are attempting to render virtual reality in our virtual reality laboratory , but we have actually always been capable of this . 
 And this this ability to virtualise the virtual reality was something that people in pre-industrial times bitterly needed , because they didn't have anything . 
 They didn't have books, after all . 
 And they didn't have photolithography . 
 They didn't have mass media . 
 The only thing they had was their mind . 
 And in this mind they had memory . 
 In this mind knowledge was retrieved , and with the help of these virtual images , the imagination , knowledge was was passed on too . 
 And that's why it is so strongly rooted in us , this ability to deal with virtuality . 
 The interesting thing about this is that I can make a short trip . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 The interesting thing about this is that at this moment the human was simultaneously the media producer and medium . 
 Now let's take that a step further . 
 What is the media today ? 
 You will notice that a change has taken place . 
 But I'll come back to that in a moment . 
 A crucial tool in information brokerage has always been stories . 
 Shamans , priests , so-called keepers of knowledge , were specially assigned to preserve knowledge in stories . 
 And today we are still very , very dependent on stories . 
 According to the author of the book The Storytelling Animal , Jonathan Gottschall , we still spend one thousand nine hundred hours a year on the reception of stories . 
 That means that once a child has reached the the the age of legal majority , it has spent most of its life receiving stories . 
 Now we think that our love of stories is based on the fact that we sat in the lap of our parents . 
 No , no , that's way off . 
 That goes back a lot further , to the pre-industrial cultures . 
 What is particularly impressive in the area of interactive media is the fact that we've anchored the ability to think in a non-linear way in our biological memory . 
 I brought along an example of the North American tribe of the Nootka Indians . 
 They live lived in the coastal region of British Columbia . 
 And as you can see , this is an area that is full of islands and so the people had to somehow navigate through there , from island to island , to find food . 
 And they did this using so-called lead maps . 
 Perhaps you've heard of that already , if you have any interest in that , in connection with the Australian aboriginals . 
 They have similar principles . 
 They don't have lead maps , but used so-called songlines , or dreampaths 
 And the interesting thing about that is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be depicted through songs . 
 And for them language had inferior importance . 
 That means they navigated through the use of sound and rhythm . 
 And these sounds and this rhythm depicted the geology and topography of a region and that of course also made it possible to defragment these songs and rearrange them so that you could move to the left and the right and could also return to the starting point . 
 Why do we no longer sing to get from A to B from above ? 
 At least not to navigate . 
 What What happened there ? 
 What happened is the the so-called machine age . 
 Before this , we were in the so-called age of feudalism . 
 Then the machine age happened and the book and then we had photolithography . 
 And what happened is that we transferred the responsibility for our memories and the the production of our individual memories to external media . 
 To the book and to the image . 
 The consequence of this is that we've unfortunately lost a good deal of our ability to virtualise . 
 Virtuality has suddenly become something alien to us 
 and has nothing more to do with reality . 
 Bruce Brown , a famous design researcher at Brighton University , went so far as to say that mass media and he means books and images , not TV , the Internet etc. which is what we would define as mass media today that these mass media have turned our memories to stone and have eroded our ability to virtualise . 
 Let's make a short provisional appraisal . 
 From the age of feudalism to the to the machine age . 
 What has an influence on our on our thinking and our ability to remember ? 
 Those are the declining influences of the pre-industrial cultures . 
 And they will they have been increasingly overwritten during the course of the centuries by the influences of the machine age . 
 That means that instead of having individual memories , we have standardised , widespread patterns of memories , onto which we can attach our personal memories . 
 We no longer produce . 
 We have an abstract an abstracted language . 
 We no longer imagine the thing in images things in images , but codify them through language . 
 We've got used to things happening in a linear fashion . 
 And we've accepted linearity as the law and there are only exceptions , such as non-linearity . 
 What's left is storytelling . 
 We're still extremely attached to storytelling as a method of information brokerage . 
 The question is , what will come next ? 
 We had the age of feudalism , we have had the machine age and we are now stepping into the so-called cyber age . 
 That sounds very spacey and like science fiction , I know . 
 But the concepts of the cyber age , they are returning these these possibilities to rediscover our abilities . 
 This is about virtuality , about non-linearity , about storytelling . 
 I'd like to explain that a little more . 
 There are technical concepts such as “augmented reality” . 
 So if you think of the Google glasses for example , then that's one of those concepts that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world again , and so that means our affinity for virtualisation , of experiencing the virtual as something normal and natural , is being addressed again . 
 Another example is so-called virtual reality As crazy as that may of course sound in the context of my presentation , we are physically moving in non-existent , virtual worlds there , according to the example of the holodeck . 
 And other Another example are the ambient , intelligent systems . 
 Those are spaces that are able to react to a human intelligently . 
 All that calls for the ability , our fundamental ability to accept virtuality as a real living space . 
 To finish , I brought along , and I hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which are the final bachelor's projects by Michael Burk , Ann-Kathrin Krenz , Joris Klause and Jan-Moritz Müller . 
 The last two mentioned are also present today . 
 Perhaps you could just briefly stand up , so people can talk to you about the project during the break if they want to . 
 I brought this project along as an example to illustrate how these archaic , cognitive models are being addressed again . 
 The whole thing is a game , I must add . 
 Which of course very much accommodates for storytelling , and it's a computer game . 
 And when I say "computer game" , you probably are imagining a number of persons people jumping around in front of some game consoles or perhaps you see yourself playing about with a some game console . 
 In any case , you imagine it happening inside . 
 This is a game for outside . 
 And it was expressly designed to enable me to discover the outside world , to rediscover the real world . 
 And this game connects the virtual world , so the data the data space that we produce , with the real world . 
 I'm sorry I have to keep this so short . 
 You can explain this much more elaborately later on , as there's more much more to this . 
 The point of the game is that I discover a city by looking at which places have been mentioned positively or negatively on Twitter . 
 And so I can have a very different view of the city , a very different impression , because I see negative and positive zones of a city and , in this way , have a very different , virtual map of a very real city . 
 We can take a look at that now . 
 Ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a short explanation of what we're about to see . 
 Of course this virtual world exists within the walls of our cities , that's obvious . 
 Using a kind of torch , we can make these virtual worlds visible . 
 Right , I'd like to summarise my my presentation by stating that the characteristics and abilities that we acquired during the age of feudalism , and which went a little lost during the machine age , that they can be reactivated with the help of the so-called cyber age and so that we can , in this way , actually go back to our roots rather than the future through complex , technological , new products . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm very happy to be here . 
 I was just asked whether this sack is a talking sack and will talk for me . 
 It won't . 
 I'll be revealing what's inside of it in a moment . 
 But for now I'll just keep up the suspense . 
 Yes , children are or should be naturally curious , and so are designers . 
 I'm a designer from birth , so of course I deal with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity in turn transforms our thinking , and why we perhaps lose our curiosity and need to give it a jolt et cetera. 
 That's a whole series of things you're concerned with besides your existence as a designer . 
 When professors become curious , they are often shoved into a research semester . 
 And that's happened to me these last six months . 
 A research semester on the topic Natural User Interface Design . 
 Now you'll be asking yourself why all these designers are starting to concern themselves with such natural , archaic prototypes of communication , interaction , etc. 
 And now I'll hold up one of these little devices , because things are supposed to become increasingly intuitive , increasingly natural , more user friendly , and then you have to look at what we humans consider natural , what we consider user friendly or intuitive . 
 And against that background , within the area of Natural User Interface Design , so the next generation of the interaction between humans and computers in the I mean in the relationship between humans and computers , I looked into how our tools , or how the computer has successively transformed itself from a calculator to a digital assistant . 
 So I looked into when things are natural and intuitive . 
 Perhaps we should take another look at this . 
 Why does this happen in the first place ? 
 So if we look at the development of our society , summarised briefly here , we are moving from the third to the fourth social generation , or social form . 
 From the modern to the computer society . 
 Each society is characterised by one primary medium . 
 In the beginning there was the tribal society , characterised by language . 
 That means people related to each other because they spoke the same language , they were able to communicate with each other , move into the same cave or another place together , build cities and villages and basically created this tribal society . 
 But the primary medium was language , something very natural , and very lively . 
 It was something you had to learn , as no small child can naturally talk , but we learn it successively and relatively naturally . 
 That was then replaced by the classical age and the first type of abstraction . 
 That was a massive outcry at the time , because of course it was when the lively language started to manifest itself in writing , meaning that I took something fluid and alive and started to carve it in stone and so manipulate it . 
 Depending on how and when I carve , a very different kind of coverage comes into being compared to when someone expresses it in a lively form , so to speak . 
 But gradually the written form became the primary medium , and gained a foothold . 
 Then the next generation came , which is where we're still primarily at . 
 That's the medium of print with Gutenberg and others . 
 That was also an affront at the time , where the gentry , clergymen and others said: Have you gone mad, If the people start to read , they'll want to have something to say and that would be totally fatal of course . 
 And now we're going into the next generation and the exciting thing about it is that a transition into a new generation only happens every few hundred years and so we're really in this in this phenomenal phase at the moment , the fact that we're experiencing it . 
 Of course it totally confuses us , because on the one hand we're seeing this new media , socil social media , facebook etc . 
 With its complete transparency , which is the new kind of thinking that clashes with the old kind of thinking: Don't say that there's now horse meat in the lasagne and not beef or other phenomena , because I want to cover that up and not confess to it . 
 And these two worlds , the old and the new ways of thinking , are clashing with each other at the moment . 
 The exciting thing about this is that when you look at it , this new society , this computer society , you can see that many mechanisms , principles and archaic patterns of thought have been taken from from the tribal society . 
 But now it's not on the local level , but on the global level . 
 We've understood that weather is global . 
 That the theme of ecology is a global theme . 
 Not , if I am environmentally aware here on the local level and the neighbour is less environmentally aware , the whole thing will no longer work . 
 That means the local village has turned into a global village with the same principles: as natural as possible , as intuitive as possible , but also with complete transparency . 
 Just like when people in the village used to know who is having an affair with whom and when , now it's happening with the extension of ourselves through mobile end devices on a global level . 
 We're accumulating our knowledge on a global level and we're accumulating it increasingly quicker and better , for example . 
 Just like it used to happen in the village . 
 Against that background I looked into what this means , what is still natural to us , what have we perhaps forgotten, and what is instinctive for us , so what difference does it make ? 
 Because people often come and ask, can't you make it more user friendly , so that anybody can use it ? 
 So you have to examine what that means , and not only change it so that it's different , because it needs to be improved too . 
 And to see when something is intuitive of course and how I , as a designer , can have influence on this and design things in such a way that they are A user friendly , so as intuitive as possible , because then the things are fun and easy to use . 
 So even while studying , you deal with the topic of perception and perceptual psychology . 
 And of course that's something where you start and look and say, okay , let me look into the inner self . 
 And how does it look in there ? 
 And how do we function , when we look in there ? 
 And what does intuitive mean and how do our channels of perception work and how does cognitive processing work ? 
 Like Steve Jobs once said: You need to dig deeper to understand how it works . 
 So you really have to go into detail , if you want to make something user friendly or intuitively manageable , and what does that mean fundamentally . 
 And there you see that , that people A our seven senses , most people think we only have five , but today there are seven officially recognised senses , and in the near future the next , the eighth sense will probably be added to it and as an extension of ourselves again . 
 And to see how we process information , how do we absorb information ? 
 And just to say , what is information ? 
 Information is every difference that makes a difference . 
 Many people use the word but don't know what it means in detail . 
 But I have to have a fundamental understanding , to essentially understand when information becomes information , when data becomes information and when , in turn , information becomes knowledge , so that I know how to later make things as intuitive or naturally manageable as possible . 
 And of course how design affects perception . 
 We can see that here, when I design things , then I can design them in a confusing way , as you can see here on the right , where I can't tell which one is salt and which one is pepper , or I can basically design them intuitively , by showing things . 
 So a lot more naturally , and though they're in a container , I can directly see which one contains salt and which one contains pepper . 
 And if I say to someone , pass me the salt or the pepper , they'd have to first think about what's in what with the right one . 
 With the left they'd just intuitively grab it and then pass me the salt , as it hopefully won't be sugar . 
 But our perception , how it deceives us too . 
 For example perception in this context . 
 The right circle looks bigger than the small one , even though it isn't at all , they're actually equally big , and yet our perception changes , depending on the context we place things in . 
 Does anybody know what this is ? 
 Come on . 
 Pattern recognition should also work . 
 Here Here it's more likely to turn into my glasses . 
 So it's a circle . 
 A second circle is starting to correlate or associate a certain similarity . 
 And if I then place a half oval next to it , we suddenly no longer just see a unit , which is the circle , the circle and , yes , we see a unit , and no longer three parts , one circle , one circle , another . 
 This is called a law of design or Gestalt psychology , which in turn affects our perception . 
 For the designers it is important , they usually have it in the first term , those great laws of design . 
 The law of proximity , the law of of continuity, etc . 
 They are usually forgotten by the third term . 
 But it's an essential component , if you want to design things as intuitively as possible . 
 The next phenomenon that is also very interesting is sight . 
 That might sound mundane at first , but it's exciting , once you take a closer look at it . 
 So we have our eyes at the front and now you think we see from front to back . 
 That's wrong . 
 First you see from back to front . 
 Because you project an assumption that you're seeing something you recognise to the front, such as a circle . 
 That means we first project what we see before we actually see it , then we bring that to the back into our seeing machine , and then we say, okay , 
 I have this cognitive feedback , you projected something you want to see . 
 And that's what's there , and comes back again . 
 Then it goes back to the front , because the back doesn't trust the front and says , now take another look and make sure that what you see is also what you want to see . 
 And then it goes back to the back and it's not until then that whatever it is is actually seen . 
 So it's a very , very exciting process , how the sequence of certain things is and the span of milliseconds in which these things happen . 
 I don't know if any of you know this image . 
 The same thing that I just described is now happening . 
 Everybody is now trying to recognise something in this pattern . 
 I don't know who recognises what . 
 Does anyone see anything specific ? 
 A Dalmatian , exactly . 
 Once you've seen that that that you can see a Dalmatian in this , you know it . 
 You'll never forget it again , because I'm showing where the Dalmatian is . 
 Now you see the Dalmatian . 
 And , what's more , you'll now always see it . 
 That means I've corrupted you to the effect that you no longer see patterns in it , and I've conditioned you , within a very short time , to keep seeing this dog in this obscure image . 
 And that's the projection of seeing , feedback , seeing . 
 Now I know it and project the fact that I'm seeing a Dalmatian to the front . 
 Then I see the Dalmatian . 
 So these are really exciting processes , which take place accordingly in this , well , it's not really a grey area , but in this rose-tinted area . 
 Does anyone know what three seconds are ? 
 A long time , yes . 
 That's our present . 
 So it's always interesting to know as a designer . 
 If I know something takes three seconds , until I slide from the present into the past so to speak , then I am well capable of bridging waiting times , in that he in that I keep someone occupied for three seconds . 
 He will have to process that as the present . 
 Then it will turn into the past and , in that way , I can bridge waiting times at the computer for example in a very elegant way , if I know this phenomenon . 
 What takes twenty-five milliseconds ? 
 Yes , milliseconds . 
 Another very exciting phenomenon . 
 It's the time it takes to fall in love with someone . 
 That means, attention, now you know that , pay attention to how long you look at someone , because I will not be held responsible for what might happen . 
 And sixteen milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon . 
 That's the period of time it takes to form most perceptions we have . 
 That means the first impression comes to us at an extremely high speed , the way we perceive things . 
 And the way we see things , what we pay attention to and how we guard ourselves against our environment so to speak , so that we can consider it accordingly . 
 Of course designers don't only look at the topic of perceptions and neural processes or cognitive ergonomics , but primarily at the topic of the relationship between man and object of course . 
 So how do humans deal with certain objects . 
 On the one hand there are the practical functions in terms of product language , so formal aspects or formal aesthetic aspects . 
 There are indicator functions , where I know exactly where I have to look . 
 But there are also symbolic functions; why does someone spend such horrendous sums of money on such a little bag that you can hardly fit anything into , even when it's not very practical ? 
 We're more on the symbolic , on the semantic level there, something we designers are also preoccupied with . 
 Going back to my actual topic Natural User Interface and the topic that's behind that is Usability of course. 
 Usability always means how can I reach a goal as soon as possible or how can a user reach a goal in a certain user context in an as effective , efficient and satisfying way possible . 
 That's what the norm says . 
 How can I make something as user friendly as possible ? 
 Can I handle it directly or do I need a manual or a correspondent training . 
 And then it's less usable or user friendly. 
 Making it differently or prettier doesn't mean it's easier to use . 
 That's something we have to understand . 
 And if you look at some of the software in those terms , then you'll understand why ninety-nine percent of today's software is less intuitive or not instantaneously usable , including the iPad in many areas or the iPhone , although it's already a lot more intuitive than classical software . 
 Intuitive usability didn't start to become an elementary economic factor , an elementary success factor , when Apple appeared on the scene , if I wanted to make technological devices usable for people . 
 Why ? 
 Because , as a rule , we can reach our goal five times faster on average , for example , through this new type of usability , so natural user interfaces . 
 You need to imagine that in the following way , if you do something with classical software and take five hours to do it , then you'd only need one hour to do the same thing with this new type of natural software . 
 That probably doesn't mean that you can go home four hours earlier , but that your employer or whoever will think of something else you can do with those four hours . 
 But what I want to say is that for us it is of course accordingly an increase in efficiency , to manage to do certain things . 
 If we go back to the area of software , here you see the first command line interfaces , which were very abstract , and it took months to understand how to handle these systems . 
 Then came the next ones , which already worked with a neural model or mental model , as software ergonomists say , because you'd have a conception of something , a metaphor , a metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer usable . 
 So no more zeros and ones with cryptic codes , but a metaphor . 
 That made the whole thing considerably more user friendly , but of course it could still be a lot better . 
 The next generation of graphic user interfaces already works with behaviour a lot more . 
 So , as a designer , I design behaviour much more much more often than appearance . 
 That's also a paradigm shift . 
 That I can suddenly That the appearance is becoming increasingly irrelevant for success , and usability is becoming an application . 
 And if I go a step further in these natural user interfaces , where I can control things via voice , speech , touch and gesture rather than a mouse and cursor , then I am even faster and more immediate . 
 But that also takes me to the question as to at what point things become more intuitive ? 
 If they become more intuitive and then I have to rough-handle my little friend here again and see what that means from the point of view of cognitive ergonomics , when is something really intuitive ? 
 And that's For us humans , something is intuitive when there's an as little as possible a need to think about it . 
 So apparently humans don't like to think very much , they want to make things relatively simple for themselves . 
 The less I think about something so to speak , the more intuitive it is . 
 And what does that mean to a designer ? 
 It means that when we can see that we can transfer existing performance models onto something else , for example the metaphor , then I can make use of that as a designer . 
 That means I can transfer an intuitive , human performance model onto a software and can so make the software considerably more user friendly . 
 That poses the question as to what is actually the most intuitive performance scheme that we humans have and now I've already given it away . 
 It's the so-called OSIT model . 
 We all use it , and OSIT is an acronym that stands for Orient , Select , Inform , Transact . 
 Every one of you is doing this the whole time , but you're doing it unconsciously and , well , pretty intuitively and also instinctively in part . 
 The model already takes shape while you're still in your mother's womb and it's intercultural , so it functions worldwide among young and old , and is used by us the whole time , without most people knowing that this model is present . 
 OSIT in itself is used by us fifty to seventy thousand times depending on the activity , it was ascertained that when you sleep it is strained less than in the day . 
 I can transfer this performance model Orient , Select , Inform , Transact to an interaction system . 
 And this kind of transferal , much like the metaphor of the desktop , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a pattern of action , a principle of action . 
 And that's on a higher grail of user friendliness than the transferal of a classic metaphor , which is the one of the desktop . 
 And if I now transfer this , if I let Orient take shape as an overview , Select as a selection , Inform in the case that it comes up close to me , and I can look at in detail , and yes , Transact means I can put it somewhere or send someone or do the shopping, etc. , 
 and then I can transfer the whole thing . 
 I'll try to do that using an example . 
 Everybody was having some cake earlier . 
 Overview: I'm interacting with the object so to speak , can zoom back out , zoom in . 
 I get the entire overview , can filter this and can say, now show me all the things with chocolate, for example . 
 And suddenly I have an interface that is considerably more intuitive and natural . 
 Because the fact that I can grab hold of things like these little pieces , that I can touch them and they come to me , is considerably more natural than when I am able to make these things accessible via hierarchically organised websites or other mechanisms so to speak . 
 Imagination is more important than knowledge , and I'd like to close on that sentence A and again give the advice that designers must also think differently to arrive at new solutions , and so I thank you warmly for your attention and please . 
 I'd like to reintroduce you to a particular aspect of curiosity . 
 Firstly , when you are growing up as a child , as a baby , the thing you are interested in is which what sort of excretions you have , right ? And depending on whether your parents have allowed you to more or less play with your potty and stir its contents , your curiosity is of course awakened . 
 And curiosity can't be learned . 
 That's why all the people who are here are actually people who have a characteristic that can't be learned . 
 My objective is to transform this entire discussion about the environment , the end of the world , forty years of The-Club-of-Rome , into quality . 
 And there's one central point here . 
 And that has to do with phosphorus . 
 Give pee a chance . 
 Every day you release+ you release in the region of two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to absorb two grams of phosphorus . 
 Otherwise you couldn't have teeth . 
 And you wouldn't be able to save energy . 
 You wouldn't be able to have bones . 
 We'd only be able to float in the earth's seas as amorphous molluscs. 
 If , in fact , we couldn't absorb and release phosphorus . 
 Incredibly enough , we we are dealing with something here that would be a matter of course , but isn't at all . 
 Because everybody's talking about energy , but nobody's talking about the phosphorus problem . 
 The phosphorus problem is much more critical . 
 We are dependent on two countries . 
 We only have phosphorus for two years and phosphorus mining worldwide is already emitting a lot more uranium into the environment than the amount that is used in all nuclear plants. 
 In the last twenty years alone , fifteen thousand tonnes of uranium was put onto our fields in Germany . 
 And we absorb all of it . 
 It causes leukemia in children . 
 And we think we're protecting the environment when we do a little less damage . 
 So , for example, protect the environment , drive the car less . 
 Protect the environment , produce less rubbish . 
 Protect the environment , consume less energy . 
 But that's not protection . 
 That's like saying , protect your child , hit it three times instead of five . 
 It's just a little less destruction . 
 If that's our thinking from from the cradle to the grave , then our our entire planet will become a cemetery sooner or later . 
 That's why we need to think from cradle to cradle . 
 And the most important thing is to look at is the soil first of all . 
 The ground stores over sixty percent of the planet's carbon . 
 At the moment we're growing corn and losing between eleven and thirty kilograms thirty tonnes per hectare , if you were to calculate it per square metre . 
 That means we're losing five-thousand times more than what is formed in the soil . 
 Of course we can look at the issue of waste first of all . 
 And everything is either the packaging or the contents . 
 In Offenbach , for example , twenty percent of the amount of waste produced by households consists of nappies . 
 And as we get older , the nappies get bigger . 
 +That is They're all in the pre-nappy stage , so to speak . 
 Right ? 
 One A baby needs about six-thousand nappies . 
 We can reduce that by ten percent of course , but what difference would that make ? 
 China can make up for that in one second . 
 It's entirely insignificant . 
 So the question is , how should we deal with nappies ? 
 Here we have a the proof , by the way , that humans are not pigs . 
 I'd like to tell you why . 
 Because with pigs , phosphorus is released in their solid components faeces . 
 With people , it is released in the urine . 
 Yes . 
 So humans can't be pigs . 
 That proves it , doesn't it ? 
 Traditionally , in the discussion about the environment , there is the belief that there are too many of us on this planet . 
 And if you deny people the if you deny people their existence , if you say , it would be better if you weren't here at all , people become grabby and hostile . 
 And so you have someone like Al Gore , one of our great heroes , saying : There is nothing more important than stabilising the human population . 
 In Israel people say , if you save a human life , you're saving the world . 
 On our end we say , the more people you get out of the way , the better . 
 Yes . 
 The first question is , are there really too many of us ? 
 If you look at ants , the weight of ants on the planet , then ants weigh four times as much a people . 
 I could also mention termites , but in the USA nobody likes termites , although they're vegetarians . 
 So ants weigh more than we do . 
 And because they work so much harder physically than we do and only live for three to six months , their weight , their energy consumption amounts to that of thirty billion people . 
 That means there are not too many of us , we're just too stupid , you see ? 
 And when you see how far removed we are from what we wanted to and could achieve , and how sad we are to be on this planet in the first place , you can understand why Offenbach , for example , has a program to be climate neutral by twenty forty , right ? 
 You can only be climate neutral if you don't exist , you see ? 
 That's your only chance . 
 Have you ever seen a climate neutral tree ? 
 Have you ? 
 Just one single one ? 
 That means our entire intelligence amounts to us wanting to be more stupid than trees, you see ? 
 You see ? 
 There is not one single tree that is carbon neutral . 
 Thankfully , right ? 
 There's no problem with overpopulation among trees . 
 There are still six hundred billion trees in the Amazon Forest alone . 
 Of those Have you ever heard of overpopulation of trees ? 
 So all of our intelligence amounts to us wanting to be dumber than trees . 
 And then you see that even something like Demeter , the strictest organization for organic yes agriculture , doesn't allow for our own metabolic waste to be returned . 
 Every year we lose about three tonnes of phosphorus , which should really be circulated . 
 And so there are too many of us . 
 Just because of that . 
 That means we feel so guilty on this planet , that we say , there is no organic agriculture , no Bioland, no Nature-et-Progrès or whatever they're all called, that permits our own excrement to be put back into the cycle . 
 Isn't that sad ? 
 And that means there are too many of us . 
 It certainly makes sense to cause less damage when it comes to the use of oil . 
 But where are we of use ? 
 We try to minimize our ecological footprint , but the point is to have a big footprint that's of use . 
 We want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the most honourable thing for us would be to not be here at all , right ? 
 Zero emissions , you see ? 
 You can only have zero emissions if you don't exist . 
 Even if you were to shoot yourself now , you'd still have emissions . 
 So you can't solve that . 
 We can do it differently . 
 We can win back our nutrients . 
 With the agriculture we practice in Brazil in which we win back nutrients . 
 This is a very direct way to get back nutrients in agriculture . 
 We do it in China for example, where we directly take the waste produced from it . 
 In In China a a chamber pot is still called a honey pot , you could say , right ? 
 And in our Western world we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients . 
 This means that the entire history of Western civilization is characterized by the city always just taking , and never giving anything back to the farmers . 
 So the cities had to keep on growing , as the farmers were moving into the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients from increasingly distance places . 
 That's why all Western empires just kept on expanding until they couldn't manage the infrastructure anymore and then they imploded . 
 You see ? 
 It was different in China . 
 They managed to have a civilization for five thousand years on end , as they were always able to return the nutrients . 
 Even today , if you get invited to dinner in China , people expect you to stay on after the meal until you need to use the toilet . 
 Because it's unfriendly to go and take the nutrients with you . 
 You were You were invited to dinner , not to steal nutrients . 
 That means you can see how to win back nutrients on the Internet . 
 The nice thing about that is that when you do that , so when you practice agriculture , generate biogas , on one hectare of land with five thousand inhabitants in the favelas , a farmer can earn about one thousand five hundred dollars and maintain the plot with it , raise chickens and pigs and ducks and grow vegetables and farm fish . 
 And the great thing about it is that the crime rate in the favelas goes down by over ninety percent . 
 So we don't have to keep an eye on the people to make sure they do as little evil as possible . 
 We can support them in doing good . 
 That's high-tech agriculture of course , but the plots take care of themselves . 
 The side product is clean water . 
 And they're designed in such a way that a farmer can farm them easily . 
 That means the rate of crime goes down . 
 And none of these plots , and we've built over one hundred fifty of them in the last twenty years , none of these plots was every sabotaged . 
 It would be easy to just throw a litre of waste oil onto it and the plot would be ruined for years . 
 That doesn't happen . 
 That means we do not need to keep an eye on people so that they do as little evil as possible . 
 We can support them in doing good . 
 So we must get the phosphorus back . 
 And by the way , if you want to get active , write this down , in Germany the most suitable purification plant is the one in Frankfurt . 
 Unfortunately not the one on Offenbach , but perhaps you can give the Frankfurters a hand . 
 Because the plant in Frankfurt would be the best at winning back phosphorus . 
 And it must go back . 
 We can see that phosphorus is really critical . 
 And we can see that it can be done . 
 In Holland we've been working on this for over three years now . 
 The Dutch government has stated that it will be the first country worldwide to win back phosphorus . 
 But we need this everywhere . 
 You see , there are two countries that control almost seventy percent of the phosphorus reservoirs worldwide . 
 There's the OPEC , a a bunch of amateurs . 
 It consists of twenty-six member countries that control forty percent of all the oil deposits . 
 And oil will be able to be replaced by other energy sources . 
 But phosphorus will not be able to be replaced . 
 That's why the point is not to to make what already exists a little less bad , but to do something right . 
 And it's the first question to ask is what is right . 
 So it's about effectivity, not efficiency . 
 In Holland it's easier to understand this , because Holland built the country on flowers . 
 You see ? 
 Imagine your your wife is sad , because you upset her , and you turn up with fifty roses . 
 Totally inefficient . 
 But totally effective , right ? 
 Or take lipstick . 
 A woman in Germany swallows about six point three kilos of lipstick in her lifetime . 
 Whereas . 
 And that Scientifically speaking , that's not not exactly correct , because because we don't know how much is kissed away . 
 But I can tell you , even in this light , that lipstick is totally inefficient , but very effective , you see ? 
 A All the beautiful things in life are inefficient . 
 So that's why we're not talking about resource efficiency , but effectivity . 
 To ask yourself , what is the right thing to do ? 
 Not burning the biosolids a little more , storing them and losing all the materials for the cycles in the incineration plant , but asking oneself , how do you close cycles ? 
 Imagine Mozart being efficient . 
 Right? 
 If I invite you over for dinner and I say : Yes , we're having a pill with Offenbach taste and a glass of water to go with it . 
 Wonderful , right ? 
 That's efficient . 
 Everything that's nice in life is not efficient . 
 When you fall in love with someone , efficient ? 
 Yes ? 
 That means that everything that counts in life is not about saving , avoiding , reducing . 
 The whole environmental discussion . 
 We tell people , oh well , you people in the South are not environmentally aware . 
 No , throwing away is exactly the right thing to do , right ? 
 Everywhere where you throw something away , from , well , you create new living potential . 
 But the wrong things . 
 If you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem . 
 To what We're thinking from a Northern perspective . 
 Every footprint is disadvantageous there . 
 When you go running , right , every footprint destroys the ground . 
 Because the soil will the moss dies and the the wind and water wash away the soil . 
 But if you're in Italy , every footprint means the water will remain in the field for longer . 
 So it's about leaving leaving a large footprint , which will turn into wetland . 
 Not guilt management . 
 We say sustainability in Germany . 
 Right? 
 But if I would ask you , how is your wife ? 
 What would you say ? 
 Sustainable . 
 Then I would say , my warm condolences , you see ? 
 That's just about the minimum . 
 So not saving , abstaining from , avoiding . 
 Every bit of waste is a nutrient . 
 And a pleasure too , if you look at how people in Italy throw out a can of Coca-Cola from their car window . 
 That's a funny occurrence , you know . 
 It's a type of territorial behavior , right ? 
 You can show that you were there . 
 But with the right design , please . 
 We've designed an ice cream wrapping , for example , which turns into liquid at room temperature . 
 You can throw it anywhere you want . 
 In two hours it's biodegraded , wherever it is . 
 And it contains seeds of rare plants , so that when you throw it away you're contributing to biodiversity . 
 That means that in doing so , we are being useful , not harmful . 
 So two cycles are created . 
 Of course not everything should be compostable . 
 A TV or a washing machine , those are things you just use , you don't expend them . 
 Only things that are subject to wear and tear , such as shoe soles , brake coverings , car tyres , they have to be made in such a way that they go back into biological systems . 
 Things that are only used go into technical systems . 
 But today we're just talking about biological systems . 
 Right ? 
 Let's take sneakers for example , right ? 
 Direct advertising , and not necessarily for the company Puma , but to help this company make these products successful . 
 Because we don't We no longer make things free of stuff . 
 Right ? 
 So if I invite you to dinner and say , this is free of chicken , that doesn't help you at all . 
 No , we define what's inside . 
 Positively . 
 So not like a detox . 
 There's nothing poisonous in it . 
 Everything that's inside can be utilized . 
 These are the first shoes with which you make a jackrabbit start at the pedestrian lights and the rubber sole can go into biological cycles , okay ? 
 It's all compostable all of it . 
 And if we manage to do it , we'll of course manage to do it for Adidas , for Nike , for Hennes and Mauritz and the whole textile industry . 
 And half of the wastewater problem worldwide is caused by the textile industry . 
 So you're helping out there , just ask the people . 
 Hey , Puma , do you are you really serious ? 
 Because they changed their chairman of the board of directors twice now . 
 And I'm not so sure they're going to stick with it . 
 So give me a hand here . 
 It is possible though . 
 Yes. 
 That which I just presented to you . 
 It's possible . 
 Today we can make things in such a way that when they show wear and tear , when they break , they can go into biological life cycles . 
 There are also technical cycles . 
 There's the a direct returning system for this . 
 It's the first biological rucksack , truly , that was made to be returned into the life cycle . 
 That too , so you can get back those things in any shop . 
 If you think about it , right ? 
 Remember those nappies again ? 
 If At the moment they're waste . 
 These nappies are everywhere practically . 
 In those countries where people have money . 
 They're on the rubbish tips , but also elsewhere in the landscape , right ? 
 If we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water tank , inside , so they can go back to a cellulose base , you'll be able to plant one hundred and fifty trees in Israel or Tunisia with one baby . 
 Right ? 
 If you just take these these nappies , shred them , sterilize them and take the powder to plant trees with it . 
 That makes the baby carbon-positive for its whole life , right from the beginning . 
 So we don't need to be climate neutral , we can be climate-positive . 
 It's about making a beneficial poop print . 
 Yes, so to speak . 
 Right ? 
 We can do that . 
 We can re-invent things all over again . 
 I founded an institute with this in mind . 
 Today , it has many employees and they can all get involved . 
 There's also an extra association , the Cradle-to-Cradle-Institute , where everybody can get involved . 
 So no more saving , abstaining from , avoiding , reducing , no more guilt management , but intelligent waste . 
 Does that make you curious ? 
 Thank you . 
 The work of the interpreter . 
 Music as language . 
 In the description of my presentation , it is written that I , as an interpreter , see myself as a translator , in the English sense of the word . 
 Interpreters are translators of the written notes in resounding music . 
 Everybody who has anything to do with foreign languages knows that a translator can't just simply render a text in another language word for word , but must also understand the deeper meaning of the words and the context in which they appear , so that a meaningful translation can occur . 
 Translating from German into English can already demand more knowledge , especially if it if one has to if it's the translation of literature or even poetry . 
 What we musicians do with our musical language is very alien to non-professionals . 
 As an interpreter of a piece of music I only have the musical notes at first . 
 Now you probably think that the composer , when writing down the notes , already includes everything they've thought of . 
 In reality the notes are very vague and imprecise . 
 These notes are about as precise or imprecise as the verbal description of a landscape , even if that might seem extremely precise . 
 Because you can't smell the flowers in the verbal description of a landscape , you can't guess the shade of green , you can't hear or feel the whispering of the wind . 
 This means that the interpreter must translate these imprecise indications in the language of notes into a different , which is to say an audible , concrete , non-verbal musical language . 
 Today I'd like to verbally translate what I usually translate into music , or interpret . 
 So you could call it the translation of a translation . 
 That's why I prefer to do it all in German , because if I'd have to translate it into English , that would be like the translation of the translation of the translation . 
 The So , music functions a lot like spoken language in my opinion . 
 The annotated notes have the function of the letters of a language . 
 So it's not enough to just be able to read notes and find the according keys on the piano or the right position on a violin string . 
 Those would just be the letters you learned to write . 
 You don't recognize the sense behind the letters until you know the language . 
 So you need at least as much time to learn a music musical language as you do for a spoken language . 
 There are different grades here , for example if you are just learning it for use at home, whether you only understand it passively or whether you can also actively speak it , all the way to the musical native speaker . 
 The work of the interpreter starts off much like the work of a theatre director . 
 Once you've selected a piece to play , because you love it , you first look into the background of the composition's creation . 
 You collect information about the piece in secondary literature . 
 You read letters , diaries , notes , whether any words or thoughts were expressed by the composer themselves . 
 You study works that have been composed before or after . 
 You make comparisons . 
 The reasons for writing it . 
 How and what did they feel ? 
 What were their life circumstances , how were the society and the politics of the time ? 
 All that interests me . 
 You imagine the time by looking at images or reading literature from that period . 
 After a while , you already have a vast reservoir of knowledge surrounding the composer as an interpreter , and you listen to them regularly , and so it becomes easier and easier to understand and feel with the composer . 
 The composer increasingly becomes like a friend you're living with . 
 Their desire to write the piece increasingly becomes my own desire to play the piece . 
 As the note is anything but a precise indication of the desire of a composer , and is , rather , a framework , I will now utilise this framework to fill it with sense and meaning . 
 Then I will say , in my own words , what could be written within this framework . 
 I play to explain what these tones might have meant . 
 What they mean to me now , what they meant to the composer at the time and what they might have meant to them now . 
 Every note , every phrase is thus given a sense , because I feel it myself, because it comes from what I've personally experienced . 
 It has to make sense in the here and now , otherwise I won't convince my audience that this is my desire . 
 It always makes for a happy concert when I have the fortune to experience the piece anew , even though I've been working on it for so long in advance . 
 It's like experiencing a happy new day afresh , even though you go through the same rituals, getting up , having breakfast , going to work , I experience the same piece anew again and again . 
 I'm a day older , the seasons change , my pulse is slower in the evening than it is in the morning, in a concert hall it takes longer for the reverberation to return than it does at home . 
 I'm aware of the breathing of the audience , consciously or unconsciously . 
 All this influences me and influences my experience of the composition . 
 It's also really wonderful when I'm on stage with my musical other half and we're on the same wavelength . 
 Then the same thing happens as when you have a good , stimulating conversation . 
 You introduce a new idea and this is answered instantaneously with a reaction . 
 It's exciting , because things happen that we didn't practice and we aren't able to practice . 
 It's great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience experienced how music communicates in a lively way . 
 In this way , every concert is a different concert . 
 I will never again play as I did in this moment . 
 I won't be able to play like I do today in twenty years . 
 I will have more life experience than today and so my musical palette will have many more nuances of color , of emotions and feelings than it does now . 
 Sure , I will have thrown some colors away too , but I will have added new ones to take their place . 
 I have a nice , concrete example to illustrate this . 
 It happened at a piano course for music students given by my beloved old teacher Professor Jürgen Ude , a well-known Beethoven specialist , concert pianist and longstanding professor at the conservatory here in Stuttgart . 
 I was much too young at the time unfortunately , so he had already retired before I finally started studying . 
 But I had the good fortune to meet him at a very young age , when I was thirteen , and so I always attended his courses while I was at school . 
 I was seventeen when I took part in a course of his and played the last of Chopin's four ballads , one of his later works. 
 He asked me what the preamble to this ballad was in my opinion . 
 It's a solemn part . 
 And , being young , I said , expectation . 
 He smiled and said , oh ? 
 That must be our difference in age . 
 Because to me it means memory . 
 He was over sixty at the time . 
 Well , at seventeen you still have dreams , but no significant memories . 
 Today , I play this piece every few years and it's always transformed for me , even though not a single note has changed . 
 It's exciting every time , because I read something new in it every time . 
 Another example from a very different field . Monet painted his Waterlilies an infinite number of times . 
 It's always the same garden , but at a different time of day , in a different light . 
 He translated the waterlilies differently , the way he saw them , the effect they had on them at that particular moment . 
 His personal impressions of the waterlilies . 
 A piece of music that is interpreted for the umpteenth time is comparable in this way . 
 Now I am also older than Chopin when he wrote the piece at thirty-two . 
 He only lived until the age of thirty-nine . 
 And it's important to me to always take a look at the notes , even if I think I know them by heart . 
 To maintain the dialogue , directly with the composer . 
 Because the notes are the only direct connection to him . 
 Especially if he's already dead . 
 So how do you start speaking the language of music ? 
 Like I said , you need about as much time as you do for a spoken language . 
 Usually you first learn to read notes in music lessons . 
 You practically first learn to read before you speak an a word . 
 You learn to find the tones on the instrument that go with the notes . 
 When you then move all your fingers at the right time and in the way the way it is written in the notes , then tones come out , which , together , sound like music . 
 Once it's played free of mistakes , the student gets their next piece to learn , which is slightly harder . 
 Beginners' classes hardly talk about interpretation . 
 Well , so it says presto at the top , so that's a fast piece . 
 Lento , slow . 
 The loud and soft symbols , F and B , etcetera . 
 Most people here have heard of them . 
 But even if you implement these indications , it still just remains something technical . 
 And it still isn't an interpretation . 
 I'm surprised . 
 I'm surprised that people often forget something very elementary . 
 Which is that to make music on an instrument one's own musical action and feeling needs to be there in advance . 
 Which is singing . 
 A child who has not learned to sing , because the parents never showed them how to , will not start singing on its own . 
 It's like learning to speak . 
 It's necessary to have one's own experiences and idea of music to then make it resonate through a further possibility , which is an instrument . 
 People who have never sung consequently never directly felt with their own body what it's like to create a tone . 
 To form a phrase with one's own breath . 
 The music instrument is an extension of our own body . 
 We use our vocal chords to to sing , and our hands and feet to dance . 
 So the hammerheads in the piano are the extensions of my fingers . 
 The melody is created through what's being sung and rhythm is created through dance . 
 The constant flooding of music today is not very beneficial there . 
 You no longer need to make music yourself when you're bored . 
 You no longer need to whistle or sing a song . 
 All one's own music is destroyed because you're constantly being bombarded by music from outside of yourself . 
 Sure there are some of you who will say , yes, but what do you do if if you can't sing ? 
 Then I ask you this , can you not sing , A , because you think you can't sing ? 
 Or B , Because you didn't learn how to sing ? 
 In both cases , it's not too late to start , to find out whether you might not after all be able to sing , or to learn how to properly use these little muscles that attune the vocal chords . 
 Because you can train that . 
 Or C , Because you were told that you aren't suitable . 
 Then my question is , how professionally competent was this diagnosis ? 
 Did you get a second or third opinion , as people call it so nicely nowadays ? 
 Or D , You simply don't like music and therefore want nothing to to do with it . 
 Which I would very much regret , because music is a lovely , communicative thing . 
 But perhaps someone just needs to change your mind . 
 Well , but this shows you , in any case , nobody has to be hopeless candidate . 
 But please don't say , I don't understand a thing about classical music . 
 I can't say whether it's good or bad . 
 Then my answer is , but I'm sure you can say whether you like it or not . 
 Because I don't think anyone will say , I don't know whether I like the taste , because I can't cook . 
 So , you don't abstain from food just because you can't cook . 
 So you don't need to abstain from listening to classical music because you don't play an instrument . 
 Listen consciously and say whether you like its taste or not . 
 Whether the music is too peppery or sweet for your taste . 
 Say what you feel . 
 With time , you will have demands and will want to have more spices in it or will even be able to notice certain fine details . 
 Why do I demand from my audience that they listen actively ? 
 Because music is a language and music is there to communicate something . 
 A work of art that is never looked at will never gather the strength to have an effect . 
 One should eat the food that is lovingly cooked by a cook , not just look at it or pass on the recipe for it . 
 So please listen when music is played . 
 It is not only a nice wallpaper made of noise . 
 When a child grows up in an environment where the adults actively make music or at least actively listens to music , it's very easy for a music teacher to ask , what color is your flower ? 
 Can you play it in blue now ? 
 And the child will play , after thinking for a moment . 
 And it will sound completely different from before . 
 That would be the very beginning of their own musical expression . 
 So the first step towards an interpretation . 
 And what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred , two hundred or even three hundred years ago ? 
 Instruments have developed . 
 There was no keyboard instrument such as the piano in Bach's time . 
 It just hadn't been invented . 
 I think Bach would have been very enthusiastic if he'd had the tonal possibilities that today's modern pianos have . 
 I can make Bach's tonal ideas sound on a modern grand piano in such a way that a baroque harpsichord was not able to . 
 Of Beethoven we know that he listened more once he'd already gone deaf . 
 Today a modern orchestra can play anything that was rejected as unplayable at the time . 
 That's why composers depend on us interpreters to reinvent the pieces again and again . 
 So that what they had only conjured up in their minds becomes listenable . 
 And also anything they would conjure up in their minds today . 
 Or anything that I imagine because they might have thought . 
 Thank you . 
 Do you know what envy is ? 
 Were you ever envious ? 
 And how did you feel ? 
 Terrible . 
 I have a friend who drives a Passerati . 
 When I turn up in my little VW clunker and park next to it , I get this feeling . 
 Something shoots through my head . 
 I say , Ulf , why do you need such a big car ? 
 It will lose half of its value in one year . 
 And anyway , you work a lot less than I do . 
 Why do I have to get such a small car ? 
 And then it comes to me straight away , it's unfair . 
 It goes against justice . 
 And when I say the word justice , this feeling disappears . 
 Our organism has come up with an excellent method to make unpleasant feelings like envy simply disappear . 
 You can also try it with words like revenge or acquisitiveness and the like . 
 I would like to explain this mechanism to you today and make it a little more accessible to you , though you're probably quite familiar with it on an unconscious level . 
 The mechanism comes from the lie . 
 But don't think of a lie you might have heard when people say , nobody has any intention of building a wall . 
 And then they start piling up stones so your view is blocked . 
 A lie like that shows you that the liar himself doesn't believe what he says . 
 And it's easily proven that he has something entirely different in mind . 
 He's only deceiving you and not himself . 
 No , the lie I'm talking about is one where you're deceiving yourself . 
 You need this lie to keep this sham , this self-deception , upright . 
 This is harder to check or bring down . 
 You need time . 
 An anecdote you might know talks about this time . 
 The Spanish painter Pablo Picasso once painted a portrait of a woman . 
 The woman then complained that the portrait didn't look anything like her . 
 Picasso's answer , just wait and see . 
 It will start to look more and more like you . 
 At this point and if you're laughing , you'll recognize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists are very good at telling us . 
 Because artists have a distorted relationship to the lie . 
 The artist tells you something , and especially this woman , that she can't see if she just looks in the mirror . 
 The artist is conveying something you can only get to know once you've looked at the work of art again and again . 
 Then that unpleasant feeling that it couldn't look anything like you and will start to look more and more like you . 
 Here you have this mechanism , with which we can use the lie as a grandiose invention to stabilize our living conditions . 
 And this turns up not only in art , but also in folktales , folktales , in in mythology , in stories . 
 Perhaps you know this idea of the lady who looked at herself in the mirror every day and said , who is the fairest of them all ? 
 One day this mirror says , yes, there is someone fairer than you . 
 Over the hills and all that . 
 And you also know how much hostility arises from this piece of truth , for the mirror can't lie , from this piece of truth . 
 But we should just realize that you can't tell a woman that there's a more beautiful one somewhere else . 
 It's necessary to always use what you would call political correctness here . 
 We need this lie here , to keep the deception upright , without which we wouldn't be able to go on living . 
 We don't only have such amazing lies in art and folktales , but also in science . 
 And here there's this story about the wife of the bishop of Worcester. 
 She heard about this book by Charles Darwin , The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man . 
 That humans are supposed to have descended from apes and that , yes ,there is at least one ancestor shared by both humans and apes . 
 Then she ran ran to her husband and said , surely what Charles has written is not true . 
 That the human descended from apes and we have a shared ancestor . 
 No , no , that's not possible . 
 And if it is , we should prevent people from finding out about it . 
 Why do we need to prevent people from finding out something that is true ? 
 Because we can't live our lives without this lie . 
 Because we want this self-deception , this feeling of being brilliant , descended from the highest beings , not from that natural level , from something as unpredictable as an organism that exists much like a stone and other such things , that's unbearable for us . 
 So we can't bear these things . 
 We have to prevent people from finding about things , especially when they're true . 
 To show you how slowly this mechanism disappears and to illustrate the traces it leaves , which lead to something other than this grandiose image of ourselves , I would like to share another story with you . 
 A particularly nice story , in my opinion . 
 My wife told me it . 
 One day she came back from her school , she's a teacher , and she told me about one of her pupils . 
 An autistic pupil . 
 She likes him a lot , because he has the tendency to be forthright . 
 And she asked him , so what are your hobbies ? 
 And then he said , well, I'm with the fire brigade . 
 And because I'm with the fire brigade , I'm interested in pyrotechnical things . 
 Yes , you'll sense it if you're feeling a little nervous at this point , something is not quite right . 
 I told my wife , whenever a person uses the word because to morally justify something , we should try to replace it with the word although . 
 You do this and then you'll see the sentence , although I'm with the fire brigade , I'm interested in pyrotechnical things . 
 You sense that that ‘s the actual truth behind the sentence . 
 A young lad like that , he's not interested in putting out fires . 
 He's interested in setting fires . 
 But there are no associations to look for where you can learn how to make a fire . 
 There's only the second best option , which is the fire brigade . 
 That's where he signed up . 
 And moreover , you don't tell your teacher that you like to set fires and are happy when the fire flares up . 
 No , it simply looks a lot better when we show that we're responsible for removing the danger that others create when they set a fire . 
 Here you have this little mechanism . 
 This This hint at the fact that the boy knew , deep within , that his connection is really with the fire , but that he can't say that out loud . 
 Here you have the censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which switches on immediately before you can do anything about it , and which shapes things you know look very different in such a way that they might sound a lot better for you and others . 
 In this way certain words come into being that we also use again and again in the language of political correctness . 
 We know that something else is really true . 
 But we know that if we were to say that out loud , social relationships will be sensitively disturbed . 
 We can't just do that . 
 It is impossible to present such things in a society that is supposed to function . 
 I'd now like to present to you what we found out at our institute . 
 According to which logic do we disseminate this deception , this self-deception , this willingness to present a reality that's different from the reality we know is valid in our unconscious minds ? 
 I would like to present to you two , perhaps three examples to illustrate this . 
 The first example works with the presumption of something many of you know and some of you value , and only very few of you don't need at all . 
 I'm talking about the soul . 
 What is the soul ? 
 The soul is something mental , Leibniz said . 
 It does not have a tangible , material nature . 
 And when you are with people who are firmly convinced that you have a soul , or , you might say , who believe that the soul brought us to life , then imagine something along these lines : the soul is an incorporeal framework around you , and it's not material , and you are just made of flesh and blood , are solid , so to speak , bound to the earth , ephemeral , subject to decay , insignificant , dead really . 
 And now you see the soul as having something of a cloud like nature , an airy nature , it's called anima in Latin , being like a breath of air . 
 And when this breath of air pours out onto a human , the human is filled with dignity , with mind , with nature that can only live with a soul . 
 And then it can leave you . 
 That's how people imagine the soul works . 
 That it comes to the human from outside . 
 We are supposed to view it as something that must be present in our lives . 
 And if you think of this condition , then you'll understand the logic behind the joy we feel when we can improve the world through a lie . 
 Because now you can implement a rule of three . 
 You'll remember the rule of three from school . 
 This is a rule of three , which describes a logic to us . 
 This , by the way , is the most complicated part of my presentation . 
 You'll need some logic here , but also the willingness to lie . 
 Namely to lie in such a way that you can simply implement this logic in the wrong way . 
 This rule of three contains three theorems . 
 The first theorem is , Klaus claims there is no soul . 
 The second theorem is thus , if Klaus is right , then he doesn't have a soul . 
 Now we have the third theorem . 
 I highlighted it here . 
 A third theorem which will turn up in people who have a strong attachment to the idea of a soul . 
 They will say , a person who has no soul is dead and can't claim anything . 
 So you sense it already . 
 Here this logic is expressed in this deceptive discourse . 
 You see it straight away . 
 The first two theorems are logically correct . 
 I can claim anything . 
 Logic does not make any statements about reality . 
 I can say , the German Chancellor is a man . 
 And if I'm right , then the Chancellor is a man . 
 If I'm not right , then the Chancellor is not a man . 
 Logic does not make any statement about what is valid . 
 I can claim anything . 
 What is decisive , if I'm right , then it's valid . 
 So when Klaus says , there is no soul . 
 Secondly , if he's right , then he doesn't have a soul . 
 These things are logically correct . 
 And now our deceptive consciousness immediately senses , I can do something with this . 
 So it attaches a third theorem to it , that has nothing to do with the first two theorems and only acts as if the opposite of the first theorem had already been proven and given priority . 
 Because we'd really have to prove whether the soul exists or not . 
 But with this logic , which just uses the fact that two theorems are logically correct and attaches a third one , which looks like it has something to do with the others , we can save our lie . 
 So we act as if it were impossible to live without a soul . 
 And we're very happy about it . 
 We can apply these things to other examples . 
 At present at we have a very modern example , which is repeatedly an item in the daily newspapers . 
 Here you have to keep another philosophical theme , a philosophical slow-burner , close to hand . 
 That has to do with us going back to the fourteenth 
 century . 
 There was a scholar called Jean Buridan , and Buridan's ass was named after him . 
 Buridan's ass is an ass that is made purely of nature . 
 It doesn't have this soul . 
 It's a natural thing . 
 And if you put it exactly between two equally big haystacks , it will starve . 
 Because it doesn't know which haystack it should go to first . 
 So it's right in the middle . 
 That's how things of nature are imagined . 
 Two equally large forces with opposite signsnatures will cancel each other out. 
 Nothing will happen . 
 Only if you come with a different example , so as soon as you make one haystack bigger than the other , then he doesn't need any sense or anything else. 
 He'll automatically go to the right thought . 
 If you imagine this , that in nature you are somehow driven , determined by the larger haystack that immediately attracts you , you will also quickly have the feeling that there must be something like a free will . 
 And as we're here in Frankfurt am Main , I'll remind you of the Max -Planck-Institute for brain research . 
 There's a scholar there, his name is Wolf Singer , and sometimes people say, Wolf Singer claims, there is no free will . 
 Now we can come up with the second theorem and say : If Wolf Singer is right , then he has no free will . 
 These theorems are absolutely logical and correct . 
 And now the thing you can almost read daily in the papers is what you find in this third theorem . 
 It looks something like this , somebody who does not have free will cannot be held responsible responsible for his actions and claims and is thus of unsound mind . 
 Here you have it again . 
 Really , you'd have to prove , first of all , whether there is something like a free will . 
 But the logic of deception allows us to act as if the first theorem were false from the start , so of course you'd have accept the opposite without any proof . 
 And now you can simply , if you want to test something for yourself and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this courage to lie . 
 Practice it when you meet a person and then say , there are no predictors . 
 And don't use the German word for predictors, which would be Prophet. 
 You mustn't say that , because that would be a little politically incorrect . 
 Say , there are no predictors . 
 You'll immediately hear the following from someone who thinks it's a matter of course that there are predictors , you can't prove that . 
 And you'll have a problem right away . 
 Because while you are busy telling yourself that you can't prove that there are no predictors , your counterpart will be very happy . 
 He'll be very happy because he's deceived you . 
 Because he led you down a path he's not on himself . 
 Because this person is not interested in evidence at all . 
 He's only interested in keeping himself free of the necessity to prove that there are predictors . 
 So through this mode of passing on the burden of proving something you are experiencing the brilliance of the lie . 
 And if you have another opportunity to enact this rule of three with another person , do it , because you will make other people happy when , in doing so , you don't remind them of their self-deception. 
 Thank you for your attention . 
 Yes , hello . 
 I took the liberty I asked Lilly , if it would be okay to mention her . 
 She's one of the organizers of this wonderful event and asked me to hold a presentation and present my idea . 
 I must honestly say , and you witnessed this , I found it hard to talk about my idea at first . 
 And she said I should perhaps present my island project , which I will try to present to you . 
 But of course it's the sum of a whole load of ideas . 
 I probably belong , are those two friendly girls still here , I probably belong to the generation that created this bad ecological image , because I already started to study engineering at the technical university in Karlsruhe in nineteen seventy nine , I think it's called KIT today . 
 And then I went to Berlin in the mid-eighties because I wanted to study renewable energies and they didn't have that in Karlsruhe . 
 There was the Leopoldshafen nuclear research plant . 
 They were all called KFAs at the time , the place in Jülich was also called a KFA . 
 Today they're called project executing organizations . 
 Because a good engineer either built great cars or nuclear plants . 
 But something stupid like a solar pendulum , which has an output of something like one hundred watt per square metre , that was a toy . 
 And in Berlin there was this crazy engineering collective . 
 I'm grateful to the person behind Premium Cola that he rehabilitated that word again , because after the Wall came down nobody was allowed to use that word , because everything left-wing was bad . 
 But it wasn't like that in the eighties . 
 At that time , there were self-governing companies and one of them was in Kreuzberg in Mehringhof , where people thought evil took place . 
 A terrorist place , but it was was called Wuseltronik and it made wind and solar power and that's where I started out in the mid-eighties . 
 And yes, a lot of what is said today really moves me , because many , many nice statements were made , which I also was part of . 
 I worked in the collective for eleven years, it was based on a grassroots democracy. 
 We were a group of twenty people . 
 If one person said no , there was the veto principle , which was totally demoralising , for ten years, I I had grave doubts as to whether I was perhaps really wasting my great engineering degree on something ridiculous , also because all my father's colleagues had told him , you wasted your money on your child . 
 He's wasting his time on nonsense . 
 And that was really very , very bitter and then you end up in one of these phases just now you saw that image with Don't give up written on it , where I asked myself after ten years , whether the one thousand Deutschmark it was at the time , the basic pay , a uniform pay in the collective of course, whether that was really such a great thing . 
 And then I stuck to it until nineteen ninety six and then I became the co-founder of the company Solon together with friends , which then became one of the biggest cell manufacturers in the world together with the spin-off Q-Cells . 
 A huge success story , but there too we have the problem of a growing company and then in two thousand and six , we , a small group , decided that we would start small again and go back and would dedicate ourselves to the next topic of the future , which , in my opinion , and in our opinion , and it's crazy again , it starts with people saying , what's this nonsense about, that won't work . I'm talking about storage . 
 I've brought along a project I'd like to introduce to you . 
 The title of the presentation was , how to reach one hundred percent renewable energies . 
 And we started asking with a relatively simple and crazy story where you could implement a reservoir wisely today . 
 On this island , that's the island Graciosa on Azores . 
 Yes, here is the data . 
 Four and a half thousand people live there . 
 They have a renewable energy share of fifteen percent at the moment . 
 The question is , why don't they have more ? 
 Because technologically it's just not possible . 
 If they use more wind power and start building everywhere , the system will start to fail . 
 That's what I always tell the politicians , when they look at our plant in Berlin-Adlershof . 
 They then also say , why? 
 We have twenty percent in Germany. 
 That can't be a problem . 
 But that's not true , we have seven percent in Europe and our network is , if you look at it physically , the European one . 
 If we had twenty percent in Europe , we'd immediately have the same problems the people on that island have . 
 The question is just , calculate that was in two thousand and six , the first contact started with the island , so just work that out . 
 How big would a battery like that actually have to be to get to twenty , thirty , forty , fifty , maybe even seventy percent renewable energies. 
 And yes , I'll move on a slide . 
 The conventional system looks like this all over the world . 
 By the way , about one hundred gigawatts electrical output on diesel fuel basis is added in the world per year . 
 That's equivalent to the output of one hundred nuclear power plants , because it is converted particularly quickly . 
 The world's hunger for energy that we are seeing is relieved with diesel fuel , because you don't need a license for it . 
 It goes fast . 
 You put a box like this over there . 
 And that generally looks like this . 
 In it , there are always three diesels running , two are always maintained . 
 Yes , that's what a What you see at the bottom is the load . 
 We were given very accurate data . 
 And the wind power plant or the solar power plant or whatever it is is generally a back-up system , or a system that can only feed into the network in small quantities. 
 Our objective was to simply say , okay, 
 the diesel will be the back-up and the wind , the sun will serve the load in such a way that they can form the bigger part . 
 And if you want to exceed twenty , thirty percent renewable energies , you have to switch off diesel . 
 That means that at that moment you have to see to it that the renewable energies can take over the entire network . 
 Of course you can only do that if you're being managed here somehow . 
 Nobody on this planet has done that in this way . 
 It exists on a small scale , so you can use your shaving machine in the car via a small power inverter . 
 People always ask me , what are you researching in Adlershof all the time ? 
 That is doable . 
 But if you want to hook up several of these power inverters and they are supposed to construct a network , it becomes highly complicated . 
 And our aim was , We wanted to reach seventy to ninety percent renewable energies and then this remainder is still here , the last remainder , the last ten , twenty percent renewable energies with , that will will be very , very expensive and generating this from batteries won't work either . 
 That will definitely be an energy carrier which will be hydrogen methane , power to gas you know alr, that's what it will be . 
 You will then rather have to go to a seasonal reservoir and balance out winter to summer and not only day to night . 
 We just wanted to know what would happen with a normal , run-of-the-mill electrochemical battery . 
 How far would you get with that ? 
 And then we tried out a whole load of simulations . 
 And we simulated wind and sun and the load , and the result , a very exciting result , was that compared to the conventional system , which needs a medium electricity price of about fifty cents per kWh after twenty years , you'd arrive at about forty-four cents . 
 Those were the first calculations six years ago . 
 And then we said, okay, 
 that's great , then we have a business model . 
 We're cheaper than the diesel system , if the price of diesel rises by five percent a year . 
 And then we started negotiating with the islanders . 
 What needed to be done ? 
 We negotiated with investors , I looked for new shareholders . 
 We were only a group of five people at the time , that could that could rebuild the organisation . 
 And here you have the graphic again . 
 The brown bit is the conventional system so to speak , the green bit is our system . 
 The fact that our system has an increase in price is due to the fact that we still use twenty percent diesel fuel and a control of the price increase doesn't break through to the other things . 
 And the Power Utility , which which the electric utility on the island , said they think it's great . 
 They said , We want to support it, but we don't think you can solve the technical problem . 
 And that's why we decided to build a hall in Berlin , where we could precisely reconstruct , so to speak , the electrical ratio of the island on a one to three scale . 
 That means we first looked for the biggest battery in the world . 
 Here it is . 
 Naturally it's from Asia , in this case from Japan . 
 And funnily enough it was developed at the BBC Mannheim , called ABB today, in the seventies , and was then licensed to the Japanese . 
 It is You can see that it's a very , very big battery . 
 It has a megawatt output and can keep up that output for six hours and it's the battery that we came up with in the technical simulation . 
 And then presented . 
 We also brought one of these diesel aggregates to the hall , in the same size as it is there , for the complete dynamic behavior of this network to actually be , so in the hall it looks like this now , the diesel is behind it , here's the big battery , here are all the converters , with which we simulate the network . 
 Over here we simulate the entire transmission guidance system, the cable's kilometer physics , to illustrate the vibration behavior , so to speak , in the network . 
 And here can you see the whole thing again . 
 We can also add a photo voltaic output of two hundred kilowatt + to the network . 
 We can see it again here We can see the diesel again here, and all the individual aggregates here . 
 And what we did , the hall was completed in two thousand and nine , and until today , two thousand and twelve , we developed practically everything that could be developed electronically and in terms of software between the individual systems . 
 So we're not battery manufacturers , but define ourselves as a company that stands between the theme of the battery and the theme of the network and everything else that lies between the two . 
 You have to be able to cater for the battery of course , and for the network , and that is very complicated . 
 The nice thing about this topic is that on this island , you can basically anticipate all the problems we will have if we want to increase our share of renewable energies . 
 So this whole discussion as to how things will be moved , the energy revolution , how to bring that about , on the island , for example , we have twenty-five-thirty percent excess energy , so we have to limit the wind and sun . 
 Of course this lends itself to a smart grid . 
 Smart grids are a hot topic at the moment everywhere . 
 We can start integrating electro-mobility on the island already , and to ask around whether the load can be managed . 
 That means that if you're at seventy percent renewable energies , then you won't be able to do that without a reservoir . 
 You can heed the share by using one of these smart grids , by developing the networks , yes , that should definitely be done , but you'll never be able to do without the reservoir completely . 
 And that's kind of the message . 
 That's why many people come and look at it , because you can see what problems will arise . 
 If we turn off the diesel , then you will no longer have this rotating mass , which causes a certain amount of idleness in the network . 
 And our European energy grid basically consists of rotating masses of large power plants , where the axle always revolves around the whole of Europe . 
 We look into this network , see the fifty hertz , and if it turns into forty nine point nine hertz , we start to open a few small valves , then a little more steam can enter , and then it goes up again . 
 That's the system . 
 And of course that's incredibly slow . 
 If you put that down somewhere , it takes a while . 
 The spinning reserve has at least ten seconds to keep the network stable . 
 And in that time you can react differently . 
 If you don't have this rotating mass anymore , then you have to replace it with power electronics and electro-chemistry . 
 And with this battery we can switch it on and off once for two milliseconds . 
 So you see what enormous potential for speed there is here . 
 And so the message is this, We have to make do without these rotating masses , if we actually want to reach our goal of twenty , twenty , twenty percent , twenty , thirty , thirty percent etc. 
 and then we have to decrease our must-run capacities in the network . 
 Must-run simply means the power plant is running too to keep up the frequency . 
 Yes , this is a huge debate at the moment , Additional construction of coal-burning power plants , because otherwise we wouldn't have , or gas turbines , because that's not possible . 
 And we're just trying to demonstrate that we can decrease the capacities , the must-run capacities , by putting electrochemical reservoirs in the network too . 
 Thankfully many studies are being carried out on this topic . 
 And to this purpose people always come and look at our experimental equipment on the , basically our testing equipment on the island . 
 And yes , the discussion always revolves around how much of the future you can anticipate . 
 And many discussions I had in the last six years were similar to the discussion I had in the last thirty years regarding photovoltaics . 
 You can't do it , it's nonsense , a plaything for kids , we calculated everything , it will never add up . 
 We have thirty gigawatt of photo-voltaic power in Germany. 
 That's exemplary . 
 And I simply assume that we'll have the same capacity of electrochemical reservoirs in the whole world for the next thirty years . 
 It's simple , that's what will happen . 
 There will be a whole load of resistance and arguments . 
 The nice thing is that I've experienced that scientists have been joining my side in the last couple of years . 
 We've been given over ten million funded projects, also to attach a ten-megawatt battery to the German network . 
 That will take place next April . 
 So you're noticing a change is taking place , from a defensive attitude to to well , to the idea, one hundred percent renewable energies is right . 
 And when you have one hundred percent renewable energies , then it's like a self-sufficient system . 
 Up till now the following is always argued in discussions , These islanders are becoming self-sufficient , they have their own little network , which has nothing to do with our joint network . 
 The The question is simply , if they become completely independent from whatever fossil or nuclear fuels which are drilled out somewhere on the planet and are brought to them , then they're an island . 
 Then they'll only be using what is available in terms of sun and wind where they live . 
 And that is kind of our vision of sensible energy use and I am grateful to the Cradle to Cradle institute that they said , Use solar power . 
 And that's what we're doing , and so in this sense we're coming together , also if you look at the presentation by Premium Cola , that it's okay to be a collective and use solar power . 
 And yes , well , I'd just like to motivate you , in the sense that it's fine to be a bit crazy and have a vision . 
 And you really have to stay pretty firm while doing so , but I think it's it's possible . 
 Thank you . 
 When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house. 
 My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio. 
 There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him. 
 "The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted. 
 I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy. 
 "You can go to a real school now," he said. 
 A morning that I will never forget. 
 A real school. 
 You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school. 
 So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school. 
 It was the only way we both could be educated. 
 Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going. 
 We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping. 
 The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room. 
 It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer. 
 We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents. 
 From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious. 
 We always wondered what they knew about us. 
 Were we being followed? 
 Do they know where we live? 
 We were scared, but still, school was where we wanted to be. 
 I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured. 
 My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time. 
 A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father. 
 But my educated mother became a teacher. 
 There she is. 
 She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood. 
 And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education. 
 There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks. 
 To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children. 
 During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future. 
 I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life. 
 Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war. 
 But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will. 
 So do you still not want to continue?" 
 Today I am 22. 
 I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war. 
 Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them. 
 Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College. 
 When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me. 
 He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul. 
 My family believes in me. 
 I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me. 
 That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women. 
 That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school. 
 The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity. 
 And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of daunting opposition. 
 Like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I cannot show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students. 
 Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes. 
 As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again. 
 "Kill me now, if you wish," he said, "but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas." 
 What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success. 
 It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success. 
 In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men. 
 Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal. 
 But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan. 
 Afghanistan looks so different from here in America. 
 I find that Americans see the fragility in changes. 
 I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal. 
 But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change. 
 To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that. 
 Like me, they are dreaming big. 
 Thank you. 
 Everything I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. 
 From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not — -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. 
 I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. 
 And I was distraught. 
 I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. 
 Instead, everything we touched we killed. 
 Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book, "Ripples from the Zambezi," was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. 
 So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River, and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... 
 And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that, so we paid them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. 
 And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture. 
 But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." 
 "Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation." 
 And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully. 
 We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. 
 And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians, "Look how easy agriculture is." 
 When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red, overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything. 
 And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!" 
 And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." 
 "Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked." 
 I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English were doing, what the French were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. 
 Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos. 
 You should see the rubbish — -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. 
 You want to read the book, read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, Zambian woman economist. 
 The book was published in 2009. 
 We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. 
 I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. 
 Just go and read her book. 
 Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. 
 We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people: We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. 
 The two words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father." 
 But they mean two different things. 
 Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much." 
 Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. 
 That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss. 
 I was given a slap in the face reading a book, "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said, above all in economic development, if people do not wish to be helped, leave them alone. 
 This should be the first principle of aid. 
 The first principle of aid is respect. 
 This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial?" 
 I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation, where you never initiate anything, you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant of the local passion, the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. 
 So what you do -- you shut up. 
 You never arrive in a community with any ideas, and you sit with the local people. 
 We don't work from offices. 
 We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. 
 We have zero infrastructure. 
 And what we do, we become friends, and we find out what that person wants to do. 
 The most important thing is passion. 
 You can give somebody an idea. 
 If that person doesn't want to do it, what are you going to do? 
 The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. 
 The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. 
 And then we help them to go and find the knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone. 
 The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. 
 So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do, why don't, for once, listen to them? But not in community meetings. 
 Let me tell you a secret. 
 There is a problem with community meetings. 
 Entrepreneurs never come, and they never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified. 
 So planning has this blind spot. 
 The smartest people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public meetings. 
 What we do, we work one-on-one, and to work one-on-one, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. 
 You have to create a new profession. 
 The profession is the family doctor of enterprise, the family doctor of business, who sits with you in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. 
 I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia. 
 I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. 
 And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets, and in three days I had my first client, and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy, and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth, to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say, "You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?" 
 And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?" 
 In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that? 
 How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult. 
 I shut up, and listen to them." 
 So — — So the government says, "Do it again." 
 We've done it in 300 communities around the world. 
 We have helped to start 40,000 businesses. 
 There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. 
 Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history, died age 96, a few years ago. 
 Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business, and this is what Peter Drucker says: "Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy." 
 Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. 
 So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. 
 You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. 
 You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in droves. 
 In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients. 
 Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion? 
 Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning? 
 Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. 
 So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. 
 We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable. 
 The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. 
 Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. 
 What we have to look at is at how we feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. 
 The technologies do not exist to do that. 
 Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it! 
 Government? Forget about it! 
 It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now. 
 There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many, many years ago. 
 There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860. 
 And in 1860, this group of people came together, and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was unanimous: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years. 
 Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million horses, and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. 
 They were already drowning in manure. 
 So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. 
 So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001. 
 The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over, and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters. 
 Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. 
 However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. 
 First, you have to offer them confidentiality. 
 Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. 
 Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated, passionate service to them. 
 And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. 
 The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be capable of doing three things beautifully: The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have fantastic marketing, and you have to have tremendous financial management. 
 Guess what? 
 We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money. 
 It doesn't exist. 
 This person has never been born. 
 We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. 
 There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None were started by one person. 
 Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland, and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography, and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline, in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word "I" and how many times he uses the word "we." 
 Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times. 
 He wasn't alone when he started. 
 Nobody started a company alone. No one. 
 So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? 
 What can you do? Can you make it? 
 Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?" 
 "Oh, no, I cannot do this." "Would you like me to find you somebody?" 
 We activate communities. 
 We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people. 
 Thank you. 
 Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. 
 Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, to teach a communications class for engineering students. 
 And I was scared. 
 Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words. 
 But as these conversations unfolded, I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. 
 That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. 
 And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication. 
 We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world. 
 Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy to environment to health care, among others, and if we don't know about it and understand it, then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions. 
 But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland. 
 So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us. 
 I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging. 
 First question to answer for us: so what? 
 Tell us why your science is relevant to us. 
 Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae, but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. 
 And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon. 
 Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas. 
 Sure, you can say "spatial and temporal," but why not just say "space and time," which is so much more accessible to us? 
 And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down. 
 Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. 
 You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas. 
 A few things to consider are having examples, stories and analogies. Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content. 
 And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points. 
 Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? 
 What do bullets do? Bullets kill, and they will kill your presentation. 
 A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed. 
 Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. 
 And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost, and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described. 
 So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering. 
 And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd, I want to summarize with an equation. 
 Take your science, subtract your bullet points and your jargon, divide by relevance, meaning share what's relevant to the audience, and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing, and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. 
 And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. 
 Thank you. 
 Hi. This is my mobile phone. 
 A mobile phone can change your life, and gives you individual freedom. 
 With a mobile phone, you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria. 
 With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. 
 And with a mobile phone, you can record a song, load it up to SoundCloud and become famous. 
 All this is possible with your mobile phone. 
 I'm a child of 1984, and I live in the city of Berlin. 
 Let's go back to that time, to this city. 
 Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. 
 This is autumn 1989, and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket. 
 Who in the room has a mobile phone with you? 
 Hold it up. 
 Hold your phones up, hold your phones up! 
 Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow. 
 That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone. 
 But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone, and how it changed my life. 
 And I will talk about this. 
 These are 35,830 lines of information. 
 Raw data. 
 And why are these informations there? 
 Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. 
 This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive. 
 This directive says that each phone company in Europe, each Internet service company all over Europe, has to store a wide range of information about the users. 
 Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email? 
 Who sends whom a text message? 
 And if you use your mobile phone, where you are. 
 All this information is stored for at least six months, up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. 
 And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this." 
 They said, we don't want this data retention. 
 We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us. 
 They were lawyers, journalists, priests, they all said: "We don't want this." 
 And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said, "Freedom, not fear." 
 And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0. 
 Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. 
 And I also ask myself, does it really work? 
 Can they really store all this information about us? 
 Every time I use my mobile phone? 
 So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom, which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information you have stored about me. 
 And I asked them once, and I asked them again, and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. 
 But then I said, I want to have this information, because this is my life you are protocoling. 
 So I decided to start a lawsuit against them, because I wanted to have this information. 
 But Deutsche Telekom said, no, we will not give you this information. 
 So at the end, I had a settlement with them. 
 I'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for. 
 Because in the mean time, the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. 
 So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside. 
 And on the C.D., this was on. 
 Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. 
 At first I saw it, and I said, okay, it's a huge file. Okay. 
 But then after a while I realized, this is my life. 
 This is six months of my life, into this file. 
 So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it? 
 Because you can see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I am doing. 
 But then I said, I want to go out with this information. 
 I want to make them public. 
 Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. 
 So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this. 
 This is a visualization of six months of my life. 
 You can zoom in and zoom out, you can wind back and fast forward. 
 You can see every step I take. 
 And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne, and how often I call in between. 
 All this is possible with this information. 
 That's a little bit scary. 
 But it is not only about me. 
 It's about all of us. 
 First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk to each other a couple of times. 
 And then there are some friends calling me, and they call each other. 
 And after a while you are calling you, and you are calling you, and you have this great communication network. 
 But you can see how your people are communicating with each other, what times they call each other, when they go to bed. 
 You can see all of this. 
 You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group. 
 If you have access to this information, you can see what your society is doing. 
 If you have access to this information, you can control your society. 
 This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. 
 This is a blueprint how to survey your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends whom an email, all this is possible if you have access to this information. 
 And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe, up to two years. 
 Like I said at the beginning, imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket. 
 And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest, and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it, this may never have happened. 
 The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there. 
 And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. 
 Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us, online and offline. 
 They want to have the possibility to track our lives, and they want to store them for all time. 
 But self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. 
 But you have to fight for your self-determination today. 
 You have to fight for it every day. 
 So, when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not outdated. 
 When you go home, tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information, they don't have to do it. 
 And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company what information they store about you. 
 So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone, let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age. 
 Thank you. 
 I live in South Central. 
 This is South Central: liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. 
 So the city planners, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else, so they change it to South Los Angeles, like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. 
 This is South Los Angeles. 
 Liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. 
 Just like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. 
 Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. 
 People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. 
 For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills, which is probably eight, 10 miles away. 
 I got tired of seeing this happening. 
 And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood? 
 I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. 
 I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. 
 And I figured, this has to stop. 
 So I figured that the problem is the solution. 
 Food is the problem and food is the solution. 
 Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. 
 So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house. 
 It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. 
 It's 150 feet by 10 feet. 
 Thing is, it's owned by the city. 
 But you have to maintain it. 
 So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want, since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it." 
 And this is how I decided to maintain it. 
 So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees, you know, the whole nine, vegetables. 
 What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group, where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life, from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer, and everything we do is free. 
 And the garden, it was beautiful. 
 And then somebody complained. 
 The city came down on me, and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden, which this citation was turning into a warrant. 
 And I'm like, "Come on, really? 
 A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about?" 
 And I was like, "Cool. Bring it." 
 Because this time it wasn't coming up. 
 So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman, and one of the Green Grounds members, they put up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were a success. 
 We had a victory on our hands. 
 My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. 
 I mean, come on, why wouldn't they? 
 L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. 
 They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. 
 That's 20 Central Parks. 
 That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants. 
 Why in the hell would they not okay this? 
 Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. 
 When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce. 
 It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food. 
 Growing your own food is like printing your own money. 
 See, I have a legacy in South Central. 
 I grew up there. I raised my sons there. 
 And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people, and I'm manufacturing my own reality. 
 See, I'm an artist. 
 Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. 
 Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautiful lawns, parkways. 
 I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth. 
 You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. 
 You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. 
 So what happened? 
 I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education, a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. 
 To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil. 
 We are the soil. 
 You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. 
 Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do, especially in the inner city. 
 Plus you get strawberries. 
 I remember this time, there was this mother and a daughter came, it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard, and I came out and they looked so ashamed. 
 So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. 
 This is on the street for a reason. 
 It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry, and this only reinforced why I do this, and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food?" 
 And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. 
 That's why it's on the street. 
 That's the whole idea. 
 I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health." 
 There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. 
 These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck. 
 It was cool, and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother, and it was just cool to see how this changed them, if it was only for that one moment. 
 So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens. 
 We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate, and it's all volunteers. 
 If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. 
 If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. 
 But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. 
 I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up -- I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them, that leads them to nowhere. 
 So with gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities, to have a sustainable life. 
 And when we do this, who knows? 
 We might produce the next George Washington Carver. 
 but if we don't change the composition of the soil, we will never do this. 
 Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. 
 I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. 
 I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. 
 Now don't get me wrong. 
 I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable. 
 The funny thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it. 
 What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the street, and letting them know the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food, opening farmer's markets. 
 So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sexy. 
 So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades, gangstas, gangsta gardeners. 
 We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. 
 If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta. 
 Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? 
 And let that be your weapon of choice. 
 So basically, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet, don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit. 
 If you want to meet with me, come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. 
 Peace. Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster." 
 Just because it sounds so good. 
 And what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician." 
 Although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said, "A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party, platform or principle, and who, when he wins, gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy." 
 Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is. 
 Something to do with words, I assume. 
 But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know they have to try and control language. 
 It wasn't until, for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. 
 And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who took on Parliament. 
 And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to take them on, and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. 
 And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass." 
 Most people think that's down to the metal. 
 It's not. It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press. 
 But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want to take you back to the United States of America, just after they'd achieved independence. 
 And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington, their leader. 
 They didn't know. 
 What do you call the leader of a republican country? 
 And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. 
 And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table, which might have made it. 
 I mean, some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington, and other people, His Highness George Washington, and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. 
 Not that catchy. 
 Some people just wanted to call him King. 
 They thought it was tried and tested. 
 And they weren't even being monarchical there, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. 
 And, you know, it could have worked. 
 And everybody got insanely bored, actually, because this debate went on for three weeks. 
 I read a diary of this poor senator, who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject." 
 And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate. 
 The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. 
 They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas. 
 So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest, most pathetic title that they could think of. 
 And that title was "President." 
 President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. 
 It was like the foreman of the jury. 
 And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term "foreman" or "overseer." 
 There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title. 
 And that's why the Senate objected to it. 
 They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President. 
 This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. 
 And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America? 
 And after three weeks of debate, in the end the Senate did not cave in. 
 Instead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now, but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations, whether under republican or monarchical forms of government, whose custom it is to annex, through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability -- not bloody President -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations, the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity, i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. 
 Now you can learn three interesting things from this. 
 First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. 
 Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time, just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. 
 Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 223 years later. 
 But the third thing you can learn, and this is the really important one, this is the point I want to leave you on, is that the title, President of the United States of America, doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it? 
 Something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. 
 Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. 
 And so the Senate won in the end. 
 They got their title of respectability. 
 And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity -- well, it was a singularity back then. 
 But now, do you know how many nations have a president? 
 A hundred and forty-seven. 
 All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc. 
 And so, in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America. 
 And that's the important lesson I think you can take away, and the one I want to leave you with. 
 Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. 
 Thank you very much. 
 So I arrived by truck with about 50 rebels to the battle for Jalalabad as a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida. 
 I traded my Converse black low-tops for a pair of brown leather sandals and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn't even see. 
 And this was my first time in Afghanistan. 
 Long before that I had grown up with the war, but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the Confederacy and religio-nationalist demonstrations chanting, "Down with communism and long live Afghanistan," and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant. 
 But this is the geography of self. 
 And so I stand here today, Afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of God, an atheist and a radically politicized artist who's been living, working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years. 
 Now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan, but personally I don't want to paint rainbows; I want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in. 
 I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich. 
 And where else can the jihadi gangster go, but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan: "Vote for me! I've done jihad, and I'm rich." 
 And try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes. 
 I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called "Payback" and impersonate a police officer, set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars, but instead of asking them for a bribe, offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they'll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf. 
 I want to look at how, in my opinion, the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic. 
 The war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests. 
 And I'd like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheelbarrow and putting it on the wall amidst Kipling's call of 1899 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday's colonial rhetoric about a "white man's burden" to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civilize him a bit. 
 But doing these things, they can get you in jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted. 
 But I do them because I have to, because the geography of self mandates it. 
 That is my burden. What's yours? 
 Thank you. 
 Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for the last little while I've been a model. 
 Actually, for 10 years. 
 And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress. 
 So luckily I brought an outfit change. 
 This is the first outfit change on the TED stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think. 
 If some of the women were really horrified when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter. 
 I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds. 
 Not everybody gets to do that. 
 These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. 
 The worst part is putting this sweater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head. 
 All right. 
 So why did I do that? 
 That was awkward. 
 Well, hopefully not as awkward as that picture. 
 Image is powerful, but also image is superficial. 
 I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds. 
 And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. 
 I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. 
 And of course, barring surgery, or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look, and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives. 
 So today, for me, being fearless means being honest. 
 And I am on this stage because I am a model. 
 I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman, and in my industry we call that a sexy girl. 
 And I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest twist. 
 So the first question is, how do you become a model? 
 And I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted," but that means nothing. 
 The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy, and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. 
 Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin. 
 And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. 
 And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe there are some fashionistas who are, like, "Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen." 
 And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. 
 But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired, and of the 677 models that were hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white. 
 The next question people always ask me is, "Can I be a model when I grow up?" 
 And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that." 
 But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, "Why? 
 You know? You can be anything. 
 You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one." 
 If, after this amazing list, they still are like, "No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," well then I say, "Be my boss." 
 Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel. 
 Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. 
 It's out of your control, and it's awesome, and it's not a career path. 
 I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike cardio-thoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right into -- right now. 
 So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there, like a nice HMI, and the client says, "Cameron, we want a walking shot," well then this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth, just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times. 
 It will look something like this. 
 Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. 
 That was, I don't know what happened there. 
 Unfortunately after you've gone to school, and you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore, so if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your résumé reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years," people give you a funny look. 
 The next question people always ask me is, "Do they retouch all the photos?" 
 And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos, but that is only a small component of what's happening. 
 This picture is the very first picture that I ever took, and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini, and I didn't even have my period yet. 
 I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl. 
 This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. 
 Here's me on the same day as this shoot. 
 My friend got to come with me. 
 Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. 
 Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. 
 And here's me today. 
 And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. 
 They are constructions, and they are constructions by a group of professionals, by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production, and they build this. That's not me. 
 Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, "Do you get free stuff?" 
 I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear, except for earlier, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about. 
 I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. 
 When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled over, and all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way. 
 And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are. 
 I live in New York, and last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked, 86 percent of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men. 
 And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?" 
 but "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?" 
 When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States, 53 percent don't like their bodies, and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17. 
 So the last question people ask me is, "What is it like to be a model?" 
 And I think the answer that they're looking for is, "If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous." 
 And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. 
 We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people." 
 And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is, "I am insecure." 
 And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. 
 And if you ever are wondering, "If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?" 
 you just need to meet a group of models, because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes, and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. 
 So when I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, "Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor," and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, "and it doesn't always make me happy." 
 But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. 
 But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now. 
 If there's a takeaway to this talk, I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures. 
 Thank you. 
 I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile: "Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him. 
 But don't you ever turn into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary." 
 Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out, inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. 
 I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. 
 And there it was, a great revolution. 
 Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime, raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice. 
 They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. 
 They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. 
 Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. 
 However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions. 
 For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. 
 Aware of the devastation and the challenges, I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society, calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation. 
 Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli. 
 After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills. 
 With an amazing group of women, I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life, to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace. 
 I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections, an environment which was increasingly polarized, an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. 
 I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background, the right to vote and run, and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists, creating the zipper list. 
 Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful. 
 Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years. 
 However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections, and of the revolution as a whole, was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. 
 One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. 
 On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. 
 On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers. 
 And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law. 
 Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom, dignity, social justice -- that we first held. 
 Intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution. 
 I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. 
 I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision. 
 We did not prioritize right. 
 For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. 
 Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation? 
 No, it didn't. 
 What is it, then? 
 Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women? 
 Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion. 
 Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division. 
 Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine. 
 We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. 
 We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. 
 We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion. 
 These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace. 
 For peace has an alchemy, and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives. 
 That's the real zipper. 
 And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically. 
 According to a Quranic verse "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem." 
 In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female, from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from. 
 And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it, the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. 
 Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things." 
 Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger." 
 May we all be granted a grace of mercy. 
 Thank you. 
 When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet, and I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy." 
 And I was very proud. 
 In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung, but we never learned much about the outside world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies. 
 Although I often wondered about the outside world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything suddenly changed. 
 When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal. 
 My family was not poor, and myself, I had never experienced hunger. 
 But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister. 
 It read, "When you read this, all five family members will not exist in this world, because we haven't eaten for the past two weeks. 
 We are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die." 
 I was so shocked. 
 This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. 
 Soon after, when I was walking past a train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory. 
 A lifeless woman was lying on the ground, while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face. 
 But nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. 
 A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s. 
 Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine, and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark. 
 Power outages also became more and more frequent, so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China, just across the river from my home. 
 I always wondered why they had lights but we didn't. 
 This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors. 
 This is the Amrok River, which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. 
 As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points, allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. 
 But many die. 
 Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river. 
 I can't reveal many details [about] how I left North Korea, but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. 
 But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. 
 I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together. 
 In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family. 
 I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee, but I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. 
 So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed, and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea. 
 One day, my worst nightmare came true, when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation. 
 Someone had accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions. 
 I was so scared, I thought my heart was going to explode. 
 If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated. 
 I thought my life was over, but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions. 
 After they finished questioning me, one official said to another, "This was a false report. 
 She's not North Korean." 
 And they let me go. It was a miracle. 
 Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies, but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated. 
 These girls were so lucky. 
 Even though they were caught, they were eventually released after heavy international pressure. 
 These North Koreans were not so lucky. 
 Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea, where they can be tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed. 
 Even though I was really fortunate to get out, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. 
 It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive. 
 Even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. 
 That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea, and I started a new life yet again. 
 Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected. 
 English was so important in South Korea, so I had to start learning my third language. 
 Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. 
 We are all Korean, but inside, we have become very different due to 67 years of division. 
 I even went through an identity crisis. 
 Am I South Korean or North Korean? 
 Where am I from? Who am I? 
 Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own. 
 Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. 
 I started studying for the university entrance exam. 
 Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call. 
 The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family, and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. 
 They had to get out quickly, so I started planning how to help them escape. 
 North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom. 
 It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, so, ironically, I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border. 
 Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia. 
 The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times. 
 One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. 
 He took everyone's I.D. cards, and he started asking them questions. 
 Since my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested. 
 As the Chinese officer approached my family, I impulsively stood up, and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. 
 He looked at me suspiciously, but luckily he believed me. 
 We made it all the way to the border of Laos, but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos. 
 But even after we got past the border, my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. 
 After I paid the fine and bribe, my family was released in one month, but soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos. 
 This was one of the lowest points in my life. 
 I did everything to get my family to freedom, and we came so close, but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. 
 I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to get my family out, but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. 
 I lost all hope. 
 At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me, "What's wrong?" 
 I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. 
 In my broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without hesitating, the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. 
 I thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?" 
 "I'm not helping you," he said. 
 "I'm helping the North Korean people." 
 I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. 
 The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. 
 Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea, but getting to freedom is only half the battle. 
 Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money. 
 So we can benefit from the international community for education, English language training, job training, and more. 
 We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world, because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside. 
 I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support. 
 I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world, including the TED stage. 
 Thank you. 
 Today I have just one request. 
 Please don't tell me I'm normal. 
 Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. 
 Remi is 22, tall and very handsome. 
 He's speechless, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. 
 Remi knows what love is. 
 He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. 
 He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. 
 He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this: He has never told a lie. 
 When he sings songs from our childhood, attempting words that not even I could remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful the unknown must be. 
 Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome. 
 He has the most impeccable memory. 
 He has a selective one, though. 
 He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga's birthday. 
 Don't they sound incredible? 
 But most people don't agree. 
 And in fact, because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal, they're often bypassed and misunderstood. 
 But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case, although they were not seen as ordinary, this could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary. 
 Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills. 
 It manifests in each individual differently, hence why Remi is so different from Sam. 
 And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world, there is no known cause or cure. 
 And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism, but I cannot recall a day without it. 
 I was just three years old when my brother came along, and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life. 
 And after a few months went by, I realized that he was different. 
 He screamed a lot. 
 He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. 
 Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between. 
 And as he grew older, he grew more different, and the differences became more obvious. 
 Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never lied. 
 Extraordinary. 
 Now, I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family, moments where I've wished that they were just like me. 
 But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normality. 
 Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. 
 It just means that there's a different kind of right. 
 And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal. 
 You can be extraordinary. 
 Because autistic or not, the differences that we have -- We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. 
 The chance for greatness, for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else. 
 Please -- don't tell me I'm normal. 
 Thank you. 
 Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple, and exposure just a millionth of a second. 
 But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million, or a billion, but one trillion frames per second. 
 I present you a new type of photography, femto-photography, a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. 
 And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners, beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray, and really challenge what we mean by a camera. 
 Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide, and that packet of photons, that bullet, will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. 
 Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle, how will those photons shatter into this bottle? 
 How does light look in slow motion? 
 Now, the whole event 
 Now, remember, the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that's how much time it takes for light to travel — but I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion. 
 But, Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research. 
 Now, there's a lot going on in this movie, so let me break this down and show you what's going on. 
 So, the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet, with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside. 
 Some of the light leaks, goes on the table, and you start seeing these ripples of waves. 
 Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions. 
 As you can see, there's a bubble of air, and it's bouncing around inside. 
 Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table, and because of the reflections at the top, you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames, the reflections are focused. 
 Now, if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion, do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie? 
 A day, a week? Actually, a whole year. 
 It'll be a very boring movie — — of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion. 
 And what about some still-life photography? 
 You can watch the ripples again washing over the table, the tomato and the wall in the back. 
 It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. 
 I thought, this is how nature paints a photo, one femto frame at a time, but of course our eye sees an integral composite. 
 But if you look at this tomato one more time, you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato, it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. 
 Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe, and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato, and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. 
 So, in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone, you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. 
 So how did my team at MIT create this camera? 
 Now, as photographers, you know, if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light, but we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure, so you're going to get hardly any light. 
 So, what we do is we send that bullet, those packet of photons, millions of times, and record again and again with very clever synchronization, and from the gigabytes of data, we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you. 
 And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. 
 So, Superman can fly. 
 Some other heroes can become invisible, but what about a new power for a future superhero: to see around corners? 
 The idea is that we could shine some light on the door. 
 It's going to bounce, go inside the room, some of that is going to reflect back on the door, and then back to the camera, and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. 
 And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. 
 On the left, you see our femto-camera. 
 There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall, and we're going to bounce light off the door. 
 So after our paper was published in Nature Communications, it was highlighted by Nature.com, and they created this animation. 
 We're going to fire those bullets of light, and they're going to hit this wall, and because the packet of the photons, they will scatter in all the directions, and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin, which in turn will again scatter that light, and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera, but most interestingly, they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. 
 And because we have a camera that can run so fast, our femto-camera, it has some unique abilities. 
 It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light. 
 And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. 
 By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense, but then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and from that, can we see the hidden object? 
 Can we see it in full 3D? 
 So this is our reconstruction. 
 Now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend, or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows, or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders, and also for cardioscopes. 
 But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is quite challenging, so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems. 
 Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself, science became art, an art of ultra-fast photography, and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging, but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding, and we look at those ripples. Remember, the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. 
 But there's also something funny going on here. 
 When you look at the ripples under the cap, the ripples are moving away from us. 
 The ripples should be moving towards us. 
 What's going on here? 
 It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. 
 The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order, so by applying the corresponding space and time warp, we can correct for this distortion. 
 So whether it's for photography around corners, or creating the next generation of health imaging, or creating new visualizations, since our invention, we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website, and our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. 
 It's about time. Thank you. 
 There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. 
 We don't bump into every neighbor, so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on, though we do share the same public spaces. 
 So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk. 
 And these projects came from questions I had, like, how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments? 
 How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time? 
 How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings, and gain a better understanding of our landscape? 
 And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts, so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today? 
 Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans. 
 My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music. 
 I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade. 
 The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. 
 I live near this house, and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. 
 In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much. 
 Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me, and her death was sudden and unexpected. 
 And I thought about death a lot, and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had, and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. 
 But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. 
 I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, and forget what really matters to you. 
 So with help from old and new friends, I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence: "Before I die, I want to ... " So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations in public space. 
 I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing. 
 And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall. 
 "Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy." 
 "Before I die, I want to straddle the International Date Line." 
 "Before I die, I want to sing for millions." 
 "Before I die, I want to plant a tree." 
 "Before I die, I want to live off the grid." 
 "Before I die, I want to hold her one more time." 
 "Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry." 
 "Before I die, I want to be completely myself." 
 So this neglected space became a constructive one, and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up, and they consoled me during my own tough times. 
 It's about knowing you're not alone. 
 It's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways. 
 It's about making space for reflection and contemplation, and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. 
 I made this last year, and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community, so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit, and now walls have been made in countries around the world, including Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond. 
 Together, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another. 
 Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people. 
 In our age of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender. 
 Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. 
 Thinking about death clarifies your life. 
 Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community, and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us lead better lives. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 So, well, I do applied math, and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math, is that we are like management consultants. 
 No one knows what the hell we do. 
 So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. 
 So, dancing is one of the most human of activities. 
 We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. 
 Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill, and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it. 
 Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. 
 So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. 
 However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have to live with incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late. 
 We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. 
 But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test. 
 You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, it's just never done. It's never done. 
 But what if patients could do this test at home? 
 Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic, and what if patients could do that test themselves, right? 
 No expensive staff time required. 
 Takes about $300, by the way, in the neurologist's clinic to do it. 
 So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this, because, you see, in one sense, at least, we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. 
 So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. 
 Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds, and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds, and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example. 
 And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training. 
 I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. 
 From the sound, we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates, and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's, so too are the vocal organs. 
 So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. 
 We see all the same symptoms. 
 We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity. 
 The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it. 
 So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases, but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. 
 So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive. 
 The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. 
 You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. 
 And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition, voice-based tests are non-expert. 
 That means they can be self-administered. 
 They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most. 
 They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens. 
 When something becomes ultra-low cost, it becomes massively scalable. 
 So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. 
 We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. 
 No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. 
 We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data. 
 We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time. 
 We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. 
 So, taking the first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. 
 With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. 
 We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. 
 Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply, and leave recordings, a few cents each, and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours. 
 Thank you. 
 So Max, by taking all these samples of, let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not? 
 What are you going to get out of those samples? 
 Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not, you see. Right. 
 You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it. 
 But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances, and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors, and looking for the actual markers of the disease. 
 So you're 86 percent accurate right now? 
 It's much better than that. 
 Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him, because he's done some fantastic work, and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well, which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy. 
 Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement. 
 So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in, record their voice, and then their doctor can check up on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease. 
 Absolutely. 
 Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody. 
 Thanks, Tom. 
 This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. 
 Those are my dad's cows at the back, and behind the cows, that's the Nairobi National Park. 
 Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely, which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. 
 So predators like lions follow them, and this is what they do. 
 They kill our livestock. 
 This is one of the cows which was killed at night, and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead, and I felt so bad, because it was the only bull we had. 
 My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them, and that's why we value them so much. 
 So I grew up hating lions so much. 
 The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. 
 So they kill the lions. 
 It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. 
 And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. 
 So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community is responsible for his dad's cows, and that's the same thing which happened to me. 
 So I had to find a way of solving this problem. 
 And the first idea I got was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared of fire. 
 But I came to realize that that didn't really help, because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. 
 So I didn't give up. I continued. 
 And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. 
 I was trying to trick the lions [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed. 
 But lions are very clever. 
 They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. 
 So he jumps in and kills the animals. 
 So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch, and that day, the lions didn't come. 
 And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. 
 So I had an idea. 
 Since I was a small boy, I used to work in my room for the whole day, and I even took apart my mom's new radio, and that day she almost killed me, but I learned a lot about electronics. 
 So I got an old car battery, an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle, and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. 
 And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off. 
 And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. 
 So I set up everything. 
 As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. 
 And the indicator box makes the lights flash. 
 As you can see, the bulbs face outside, because that's where the lions come from. 
 And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. 
 The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed, but I was sleeping in my bed. 
 Thanks. 
 So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions. 
 And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. 
 One of them was this grandmother. 
 She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions, and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. 
 And I said, "Yes." 
 So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights. 
 Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community, and they're really working. 
 And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards, and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. 
 Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited about this. 
 My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. 
 I even took my friends back to my community, and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. 
 So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows, and I used to see planes flying over, and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside. 
 And here I am today. 
 I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. 
 So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. 
 I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. 
 Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. 
 You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. 
 So you got this scholarship. Yep. 
 You're working on other electrical inventions. 
 What's the next one on your list? 
 My next invention is, I want to make an electric fence. Electric fence? 
 But I know electric fences are already invented, but I want to make mine. 
 You already tried it once, right, and you -- I tried it before, but I stopped because it gave me a shock. 
 In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else. 
 We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. 
 Thank you so much. Thank you. 
 Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of them. 
 There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. 
 In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. 
 My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. 
 We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. 
 Well you can see where this is going. 
 Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?" 
 This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. 
 You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. 
 No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. 
 Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. 
 It's really become sacred to us. 
 This one was taken just weeks after 9/11, and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand. 
 So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment, or even a specific trip. 
 They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and not just physically, but in every way. 
 Because while we take the same photo, our perspectives change, and she reaches new milestones, and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she interacts with and sees everything. 
 This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. 
 Recently, on one trip, we were walking, and she stops dead in her tracks, and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips. 
 And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot. 
 She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier. 
 And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges, because she's determined to go to school in New York. 
 And it hit me: One of the most important things we all make are memories. 
 So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. 
 I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos. 
 I'm always the one taking the picture. 
 So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot, and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask, "Will you take our picture?" 
 Thank you.
